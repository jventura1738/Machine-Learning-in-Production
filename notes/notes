IDEAS FOR NEXT ROUND:

CODE SNIPPETS IN README:
	- readme's with a lot of code sections tend to be indicative
	  of some sort of library to be imported.

IMAGES IN README:
	- no images seem to be a bad sign.
	- images with demonstrations are a good sign.

REPOSITORY SIZE ANALYSIS:
	- repo's with little code (small number of bytes) tend to
	  be books/guides/reading lists etc.

LANGUAGE ANALYSIS:
	- if the main language is TeX, Jupyter Notebooks, or None,
	  this is a bad sign.
