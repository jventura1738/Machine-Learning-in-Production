GitQlient, pronounced as git+client (/gɪtˈklaɪənt/) is a multi-platform Git client originally forked from QGit. Nowadays it goes beyond of just a fork and adds a lot of new functionality.

## User Manual

Please, if you have any doubts about how to use it or you just want to know all you can do with GitQlient, take a look to [the user manual in here](https://francescmm.github.io/GitQlient).

It is planned to release for Linux, MacOs and Windows. However, take into account that the development environment is based on Linux and it will be the first platform released.

## How to install GitQlient

### Linux

#### AppImage

GitQlient is offered in the form of AppImage. Although a big binary, it includes all the libraries needed to run. It is a portable multi-OS version so just download the versio you want from the [releases page](https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/releases) and execute it (make sure it has execution rights).

#### RPM package for Fedora

Package [available](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gitqlient) in official Fedora repos. To install, type the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo dnf install gitqlient
```

#### DEB package for Ubuntu

For now there is no GitQlient in the official repos of Ubuntu or Debian. However, to install it via .deb package, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/releases) and download the package from the version you want. Once you download it, you can install it using apt-get command as root.

**Note:** This option is available only from GitQlient 1.4.0 (when this version is published).

All L

### Windows

For Windows 10 there is a package provided on every release. It installs all the dependencies and creates an shortcut in the Desktop. From the [releases page](https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/releases), download the GitQlientInstaller-<version>.exe binary from the release you want to use.

### MacOS

For MacOS there is also a DMG package you can install as usual. Take into account that because of lack of resources this version is not tested.

## Translating GitQlient

GitQlient is using the translation system of Qt. That means that for every new language two files are needed: .ts and .qm. The first one is the text translation and the second one is a compiled file that GitQlient will load.

To add a new translation, please generate those files and add them to the resources.qrc.

For more information on [Qt translation system](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-manager.html).

### Building GitQlient

In the [User Manual](https://francescmm.github.io/GitQlient/#appendix-b-build) you can find a whole section about building GitQlient and what dependencies you need.
