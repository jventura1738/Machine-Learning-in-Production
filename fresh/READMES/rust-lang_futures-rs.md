`futures-rs` is a library providing the foundations for asynchronous programming in Rust.
It includes key trait definitions like `Stream`, as well as utilities like `join!`,
`select!`, and various futures combinator methods which enable expressive asynchronous
control flow.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
futures = "0.3"
```

Now, you can use futures-rs:

```rust
use futures::future::Future;
```

The current futures-rs requires Rust 1.41 or later.

### Feature `std`

Futures-rs works without the standard library, such as in bare metal environments.
However, it has a significantly reduced API surface. To use futures-rs in
a `#[no_std]` environment, use:

```toml
[dependencies]
futures = { version = "0.3", default-features = false }
```
