Roadmap
-------

v3 (early 2021)
###############

* Initial Django 3.x support
* Latest Jinja support
* Deprecate theme folders under Shuup front which are used to override
  individual macros in macro folders. This does not work well with latest
  Jinja and adds extra complexity.

v4 (mid 2021)
#############

* Move Shuup front, xtheme and theming features to own addons. This so that
  projects not ready for updating theme or front can still get latest Shuup.
* Introduce new default theme and overhaul templates structure to be more
  simple (likely Bootstrap 5 will be used).
* Bump admin Bootstrap version to match with the new front
* Move various other not essential apps in this repository to addons for
  better version management.

Additional Material

* `Django-project template <https://github.com/shuup/shuup-project-template>`__. Django-project template.
