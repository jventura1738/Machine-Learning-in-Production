## Android Studio Shortcuts

IDE shortcuts can really make your development workflow fast and smooth and Android Studio shines perfectly in this aspect. Ideally, you should make it a habit to not pick up the mouse to perform most of your actions and slowly migrate towards a mouseless-workflow. Here are some of the most useful shortcuts for you to get started.

*(Currently, only Mac shortcuts are available. Windows and Linux shortcuts coming soon.)*

  * `Toast` - Creates a new `Toast.makeText(context, "", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();` toast
  * `newInstance` - Generates the static `newInstance` factory method in a  Fragment with arguments
  * `noInstance` - Generates a private empty constructor to prevent instance creation

  * `Parcelable` - Generates the boilerplate code for Pacelable implementation
  * `fbc` - Generates the `findViewById` code with the appropriate cast
  * `const` - Generates a constant according to Android's coding conventions
  * `logd` - Generates `Log.d(TAG, "");` log. Check the other variants as well
  * `logm` - Generates a log with the current method name and its arguments
  * `logr` - Generates a log result of the current method
  * `psf` - Generates the boilerplate `public static final`. Also check `psfi` and `psfs`
  * `key` - Generates the key constant for a Bundle
  * `sout` - Prints a string to `System.out`. Also check `soutm` and `soutp`
  * `visible` - Sets a view's visibility to VISIBLE
