This repo contains a _Helm chart_ for JupyterHub and a guide to use it. Together
they allow you to make a JupyterHub available to a very large group of users
such as the staff and students of a university.

## The guide

The [Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes guide](https://z2jh.jupyter.org)
provides user-friendly steps to _deploy_
[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) on a cloud using
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

The guide is complemented well by the [documentation for JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io).

## The Helm chart

The JupyterHub Helm chart lets a user create a reproducible and maintainable
deployment of JupyterHub on a Kubernetes cluster in a cloud environment. The
released charts are made available in our [Helm chart
repository](https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart).

## Notice of Participation in Study

Please note that this repository is participating in a study into sustainability
of open source projects. Data will be gathered about this repository for
approximately the next 12 months, starting from 2021-06-11.

Data collected will include number of contributors, number of PRs, time taken to

## History

Much of the initial groundwork for this documentation is information learned
from the successful use of JupyterHub and Kubernetes at UC Berkeley in their
[Data 8](http://data8.org/) program.
