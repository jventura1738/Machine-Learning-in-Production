# CNCF Serverless WG

The original intent of the CNCF Serverless Working Group was to explore the
intersection of cloud native and serverless technology. As a result of that
work the following artifacts were produced:

* [A Serverless Overview Whitepaper](#serverless-overview-whitepaper)
* [Landscape](#landscape)

Since then the CNCF TOC agreed to have the working group continue its work
and develop the
[CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md)
specification. That work is being done in a separate github repo:
[CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec).

In addition to [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/spec.md)
specification, the Serverless WG has agreed to form a sub working group to
work on a separate stream called "Serverless Workflow". This work is
being done in the [Workflow](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless/tree/master/workflow/spec)
directory.

Additional work streams can be suggested, see the proposal directory's
[README](proposals/README.md) for more information.

The TOC sponsor of this WG is Ken Owens.
