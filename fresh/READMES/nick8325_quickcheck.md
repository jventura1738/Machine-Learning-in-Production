This is QuickCheck 2, a library for random testing of program properties.

Add `QuickCheck` to your package dependencies to use it in tests or REPL.

The quickcheck-instances [1] companion package provides instances for types in
Haskell Platform packages at the cost of additional dependencies.

The make-hugs script makes a Hugs-compatible version of QuickCheck.
It may also be useful for other non-GHC implementations.
