Materials for Windows Malware Analysis training (volume 1)

## *🚧 WARNING: work in progress! More material will be added gradually.*

### Content

The goal of this training it to build understanding of various common techniques used by malware. It contains elements of programming as well as reverse engineering, and introduction to some Windows internals concepts. 

It also showcases how various tools (including my own) can be used to achieve particular analysis goals.

### Target audience

This material would fit best to people who already have technical knowledge from surrounding areas: basics of programming and reverse engineering - yet, who want to **enter into the field of Windows malware analysis**.
