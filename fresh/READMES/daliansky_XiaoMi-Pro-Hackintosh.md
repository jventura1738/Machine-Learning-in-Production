- **Ethernet may not work on macOS10.15, view [#256](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro-Hackintosh/issues/256)**
- In macOS10.15, you need to update [Wireless-USB-Adapter Driver](https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Adapter/releases)
  - If you are not using macOS10.15, it's still recommended to update the driver above
- **Discrete graphic card** is not working, since macOS doesn't support Optimus technology
  - Have used `SSDT-DDGPU` to disable it in order to save power
- **Fingerprint sensor** is not working
  - Have used `SSDT-USB` to disable it in order to save power
- **Intel Bluetooth** does not support some Bluetooth devices
  - View [Work-Around-with-Bluetooth](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro-Hackintosh/wiki/Work-Around-with-Bluetooth)
- **Intel Wi-Fi** works with low performance
  - Buy a USB Wi-Fi dongle or supported wireless card
  - Read [Frequently Asked Questions](https://openintelwireless.github.io/itlwm/FAQ.html) for more information

## Installation

### Identify Your Model

If you are using XiaoMi-Pro with **8th Gen** CPU, then it's a **KBL** (Kaby Lake) machine. (Actually Kaby Lake Refresh)  
If you are using XiaoMi-Pro with **10th Gen** CPU, then it's a **CML** (Comet Lake) machine.  
You will need this information when you download the [EFI release](https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro-Hackintosh/releases).


### First-time installation

- Please refer to the following installation tutorials
  - [Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro High Sierra 10.13.6](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-xiaomi-mi-notebook-pro-high-sierra-10-13-6.242724)
  - [Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro MacOS Catalina Installation Guide || ENGLISH](https://bit.ly/34biTqw)

- Build the latest beta EFI by running the following command in Terminal:
```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro-Hackintosh/main/makefile.sh)"
```
- Or run the following command in Terminal:
```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/daliansky/XiaoMi-Pro-Hackintosh.git
cd XiaoMi-Pro-Hackintosh
./makefile.sh
```
- Some advanced usages are:
```shell
# Ignore errors when the script is running
./makefile.sh --IGNORE_ERR
# Bundled with Chinese verison Docs
./makefile.sh --LANG=zh_CN
# Generate EFI release for Comet Lake model
./makefile.sh --MODEL=CML
# Preserve work files during the building stage

## FAQ

#### My touchpad isn't working after update.

You need to rebuild the kext cache after every system update. Use `Kext Utility.app` or type `sudo kextcache -i /` in `Terminal.app`. Then restart. If this still doesn't work, try to press F9.

#### I can't click to drag files using the trackpad.

Starts from [VoodooI2C v2.4.1](https://github.com/alexandred/VoodooI2C/releases/tag/2.4.1), the click down action is emulated to force touch, which causes the failure of click down and drag gestures. You can turn off `Force Click` in `SysPref - Trackpad` or choose `three finger drag` in `SysPref - Accessibility - Mouse & Trackpad - Trackpad Options`.

#### My screen turns to black and has no response during the updating process.

If you have black screen for five minutes and get no response from the device, please force restart your laptop(Long press power button) and choose `Boot macOS Install from ~` entry.

#### My device is locked by `Find My Mac` and can't be booted, what should I do now?

For Clover users, press `Fn+F11` when you are in Clover boot page. Then Clover will refresh `nvram.plist`, and lock message should be removed.  
For OC users, press `Esc` to enter the boot menu during startup. Then, press `Space` key and choose `Reset NVRAM`.

#### [Clover] I opened the `FileVault`, and I can't find macOS partition in Clover boot page, how can I solve it?

It is not recommended to open `FileVault`. You can press `Fn+F3` in the Clover boot page and choose the icon with `FileVault`. Then you can boot in the system and close `FileVault`.

#### [OC] How to skip the boot menu and automatically boot into the system?

First, in macOS, open `SysPref - Startup Disk`. Choose the target system.  
Then, open `/EFI/OC/config.plist`, and turn off `ShowPicker`.  
When you want to switch OS, press `Esc` during startup to call the boot menu.

#### [OC] How to enable startup chime? (TM1701 & TM1707)

Change `#AudioDxe.efi` to `AudioDxe.efi` in `config.plist - UEFI - Drivers`.  
Enable `AudioSupport` in `config.plist - UEFI - Audio`.  
If you are using macOS Big Sur, go to `SysPref - Sound` and turn on `Play sound on startup`.  
For macOS version  < Big Sur, open `Terminal.app` and run `sudo nvram StartupMute=%00`.
