# Learn Blockchain By Building Your Own In JavaScript

This repository is the source code that accompanies a course on Udemy.com that teaches students how blockchain technology works by coding out their own blockchain prototype in javascript.

The course is called **[Learn Blockchain By Building Your Own In JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/build-a-blockchain-in-javascript/?couponCode=GHDISCOUNT)** and it can be found **[here](https://www.udemy.com/build-a-blockchain-in-javascript/?couponCode=GHDISCOUNT)**.

## Course Content

In this course you will build out your very own **blockchain** and **decentralized blockchain network** using the javascript programming language.

In this course you will learn all of the following concepts and your blockchain will have all of the following features:

- A **proof of work** algorithm to secure the network.
- **Hashing algorithms** to secure the data within the blockchain.
- The ability to **mine (create) new blocks** that contain data.
- The ability to **create transactions** and store them in blocks.
- An **API/server** that will be used to interact with the blockchain from the internet.
- It will be hosted on a **decentralized blockchain network**.
- A **consensus algorithms** to verify that the network nodes have valid data and are synchronized.
- A **broadcasting system** to keep the data in the blockchain network synchronized.
- Many other awesome features!...

When you have completed this course you will have built out **your own blockchain prototype in code**.  You will have a thorough understanding of how blockchain technology actually works and why this technology is so **secure and valuable**.  You will also have a deep understanding of how decentralized blockchain networks function and why decentralization is such an important feature for securing the blockchain. The whole process of **storing, securing, and validating data/transactions** on the blockchain will become very clear.
