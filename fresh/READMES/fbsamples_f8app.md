## How We Build It

We've created a series of tutorials at http://makeitopen.com/ that explain how we built the app, and that dive into how we used React Native, Redux, Relay, GraphQL, and more.

Check out how to set the app up for local development [here](http://makeitopen.com/docs/en/1-A1-local-setup.html)!
