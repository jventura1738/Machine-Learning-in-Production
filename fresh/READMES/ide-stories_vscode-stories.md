[**Stories**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bar9.stories): a cool way of sharing code snippets with other developers.

## Getting Started

You can download Stories from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bar9.stories).

_or search `stories` in your VSCode Extensions_

Once you have it, you should see `stories` in VSCode similar to this:

## 2-Step Process to Create your own story

#### Step One

- You can click the Stories Icon button or open up the panel to access the stories.
- Once you have that open up, click on anyone's profile picture, and you'll be shown a snippet of their code of what they're currently working on, thus Stories!
