BulletinBoard is an iOS library that generates and manages contextual cards displayed at the bottom of the screen. It is especially well suited for quick user interactions such as onboarding screens or configuration.

It has an interface similar to the cards displayed by iOS for AirPods, Apple TV/HomePod configuration and NFC tag scanning. It supports both the iPhone, iPhone X and the iPad.

It has built-in support for accessibility features such as VoiceOver and Switch Control.

Here are some screenshots showing what you can build with BulletinBoard:
