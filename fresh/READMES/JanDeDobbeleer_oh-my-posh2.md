## Introducing V3 and what it means for V2

It's been an amazing ride for Oh myPosh, but the time has come to step it up a notch.
Developers nowadays no longer stick to one shell/language, they are all tools we use to solve a certain problem.
The same needs to apply to Oh my Posh. It's time to adjust to that philosophy.

That's why this version of Oh my Posh is entering maintenance mode while I'm working hard on getting [V3][v3] out of the door.
Given that [V3][v3] is entirely different under the hood, it's hosted [separately][v3] for now.
From a user perspective, it should give the same experience out-of-the-box, with the added advantage
that custom themes are a first class, no code citizen.

```powershell
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser -AllowPrerelease
```

[Documentation][docs-v3] is also available which should give a better experience than this **README** has over the past few years :-)

If you're a developer looking to add functionality, please have a look at [V3][v3] to see if it already exists there.
If not, feel free to create an issue or PR on [V3][v3], _**I will only be accepting bug fixes on V2 from now on**_.

## About

A theme engine for Powershell inspired by the work done by Chris Benti on [PS-Config][chrisbenti-psconfig] and [Oh-My-ZSH][oh-my-zsh] on OSX and Linux (hence the name).

More information about why I made this can be found on my [blog].

![Theme][img-indications]

Features:

- Easy installation
- Awesome prompt themes for PowerShell in ConEmu
- Git status indications (powered by posh-git)
- Failed command indication
- Admin indication
- Current session indications (admin, failed command, user)
- Configurable
- Easily create your own theme
- Separate settings for oh-my-posh and posh-git
- Does not mess with the default Powershell console

## Prerequisites

You should use a modern console host like [ConEmu][conemu], [Alacritty][alacritty], [Terminus][terminus], [Hyper][hyper], [FluentTerminal][fluentterminal], or the official [Windows Terminal][windowsterminal] to have a great terminal experience on Windows.

There are multiple ways to acquire Windows Terminal - from the Microsoft [Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701), the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases), or the below commandline methods:

Via [WinGet][winget] (official package manager for Windows):

```powershell
winget install --id=Microsoft.WindowsTerminal -e
```

Via [Chocolatey][chocolatey]:

```powershell
choco install microsoft-windows-terminal
```

Via [Scoop][scoop]:

```powershell
scoop install windows-terminal
```

The fonts I use are Powerline fonts, there is a great [repository][nerdfonts] containing them.
I use `Meslo LG M Regular for Powerline Nerd Font` in my ConEmu setup together with custom colors. You can find my theme [here][theme-gist].

In case you notice weird glyphs after installing a font of choice, make sure the glyphs are available (maybe they have a different location in the font, if so, adjust the correct `$ThemeSettings` icon). If it turns out the character you want is not supported, select a different font.

## Installation

You need to use the [PowerShell Gallery][powershell-gallery] to install oh-my-posh.

Install posh-git and oh-my-posh:

```powershell
Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser
```

Enable the prompt:

```powershell
# Start the default settings
Set-Prompt
# Alternatively set the desired theme:
Set-Theme Agnoster
```

In case you're running this on PS Core, make sure to also install version 2.0.0-beta1 of `PSReadLine`

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -AllowPrerelease -Scope CurrentUser -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
```

To enable the engine edit your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE )) { New-Item -Type File -Path $PROFILE -Force }
notepad $PROFILE
```

Append the following lines to your PowerShell profile:

```powershell
Import-Module posh-git
Import-Module oh-my-posh
Set-Theme Paradox
```

The last command sets the theme for the console. Check the available themes list below.

## Configuration

List the current configuration:

```powershell
$ThemeSettings
```

![Theme][img-themesettings]

You can tweak the settings by manipulating `$ThemeSettings`.
This example allows you to tweak the branch symbol using a unicode character:

```powershell
$ThemeSettings.GitSymbols.BranchSymbol = [char]::ConvertFromUtf32(0xE0A0)
```

Also do not forget the Posh-Git settings itself (enable the stash indication for example):

```powershell
$GitPromptSettings
```

Hide your `username@domain` when not in a virtual machine for the Agnoster, Fish, Honukai, Paradox and Sorin themes:

```powershell
$DefaultUser = 'yourUsernameHere'
```

## Helper functions

`Set-Theme`: set a theme from the Themes directory. If no match is found, it will not be changed. Autocomplete is available to list and complete available themes.

```powershell
Set-Theme paradox
```

`Show-ThemeColors`: display the colors used by the theme

![Theme][img-themecolors]

`Show-Colors`: display colors configured in ConEmu

![Theme][img-showcolors]

## Creating your own theme

If you want to create a theme it can be done rather easily by adding a `mytheme.psm1` file in the folder indicated in `$ThemeSettings.MyThemesLocation` (the folder defaults to `~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\PoshThemes`, feel free to change it).

The only required function is `Write-Theme`. You can use the following template to get started:

```powershell
#requires -Version 2 -Modules posh-git

function Write-Theme
{
    param(
        [bool]
        $lastCommandFailed,
        [string]
        $with
    )

    # enter your prompt building logic here
}

$sl = $global:ThemeSettings #local settings
```

Feel free to use the public helper functions `Get-VCSStatus`, `Get-VcsInfo`, `Get-FormattedRootLocation`, `Get-ShortPath`, `Set-CursorForRightBlockWrite`, `Set-CursorUp`, `Set-Newline` or add your own logic completely.

To test the output in ConEmu, just switch to your theme:

```powershell
Set-Theme mytheme
```

If you want to include your theme in oh-my-posh, send me a PR and I'll try to give feedback ASAP.

Happy theming!

### Adding stack count to a custom theme

As it seems getting access to the stack information when using pushd/popd is sort of mission impossible from within a theme, you can use a workaround proposed by [Jonathan Leech-Pepin][jleechpe]. In your `$PROFILE`, add a variable that will act as a correctly scoped pointer to fetch the stack context:

```powershell
$getStackContext = {Get-Location -Stack}
```

Next, in your custom theme, access the information you want to display:

```powershell
$stackCount = (&$getStackContext).count
```

### iTerm2 is creating notifications every time

This is caused by the `ConsoleTitle` functionality.
As explained by [Andrew Stanton-Nurse][consoletitle] it's linked to how terminals work with OSC codes.
The fix is to disable the `ConsoleTitle` functionality when in iTerm2 by adding the following snippet to your `$PROFILE`.

```powershell
if($env:LC_TERMINAL -eq "iTerm2") {
    $ThemeSettings.Options.ConsoleTitle = $false
}
```
