Mac-Scripts
===========

Automation scripts focused around Mac OS X Server

:exclamation: **Very Important Security Information:**

*Our scripts and installers require administrative user passwords to run. We post all our source code to the repositories. For example: if you run the install command for our MySQL install script, your computer downloads the latest version of the script from this URL http://git.io/eUx7rg. You can view the entire contents of the script and see that nothing out of the ordinary is being done with your system or password. You can read more about us by visiting our [website](http://www.macminivault.com).* 

**IF YOU DO NOT KNOW OR TRUST A PROGRAM/APPLICATION ASKING YOU TO ENTER YOUR ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD, YOU SHOULD NOT DO SO.**
