PhotoPrism¬Æ is a privately hosted app for browsing, organizing, and sharing your photo collection.
It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find pictures automatically without getting in your way.
Say goodbye to solutions that force you to upload your visual memories to the cloud!

To get a first impression, you're welcome to play with our public demo at [demo.photoprism.org](https://demo.photoprism.org/).

## Key Features ##

* Our intuitive [user interface](https://demo.photoprism.org/) makes browsing and organizing your photo collection as easy as 
  it should be ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer.
* Index everything without worrying about duplicates or [RAW to JPEG conversion](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/library/converting/).
* Automatic [image classification](https://docs.photoprism.org/developer-guide/metadata/classification/) 
  based on Google TensorFlow. In addition, our indexer detects _colors_, _chroma_, _luminance_, _quality_, _panoramic projection_, 
  _location type_, and many other properties.
* Includes four high-resolution [world maps](https://demo.photoprism.org/places) to see where you've been,
  and for rediscovering long-forgotten shots.
* WebDAV clients, like Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, may 
  [connect](https://docs.photoprism.org/user-guide/sync/webdav/) directly to PhotoPrism so that you to can open, 
  edit, and delete files from your computer or phone as if they were local. 
  You may easily sync your pictures with [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/) as well.  
* Because PhotoPrism is built as a [progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps),
  it provides a native app-like experience, and you may install it on your home screen.
  There's also a [community-maintained native app in development](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism-mobile).

## Getting Started ##

Step-by-step installation instructions for our self-hosted [community edition](https://photoprism.app/get) can be found 
on [docs.photoprism.org](https://docs.photoprism.org/getting-started/) -
all you need is a Web browser and Docker to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

We recommend hosting PhotoPrism on a server with **at least 2 cores** and **4 GB of memory**.
Beyond these minimum requirements, the amount of RAM should match the number of cores.
Indexing large photo and video collections significantly benefits from fast, local SSD storage.

## Roadmap ##

Our vision is to provide the most user-friendly solution for browsing, organizing, and sharing your photo collection.
The [roadmap](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/projects/5) shows what tasks are in progress, 
what needs testing, and which feature requests are going to be implemented next.
