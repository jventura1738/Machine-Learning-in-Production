# wujian100_open
    wujian100_open is a MCU base SoC. We can simulate by EDA tools and emulate by FPGA. Also we can develop the IPs and software in this platform. We wish more and more developers building the open MCU ecosystem with T-Head. IC design and development should be faster simpler and more reliable

# Get Started
    1. prepare a project work directory just like 'Project'
    2. cd Project
    3. git clone https://github.com/T-head-Semi/wujian100_open.git or git clone git@github.com:T-head-Semi/wujian100_open.git
# Download C/C++ Compiler
    1. prepare a tool chain install directory named 'riscv_toolchain'  // use the c shell command like 'mkdir riscv_toolchain'
    2. download the tool chain from the url https://occ.t-head.cn/community/download?id=3913221581316624384
    3. install the tool chain to the riscv_toolchain dirctory
# Get open source EDA tools
    centos7/rhel7:  sudo yum install iverilog verilator gtkwave
    ubuntu/debian:  sudo apt-get install iverilog verilator gtkwave
# Get ready for simulation
    1. cd wujian100_open/tools
    2. vim setup.csh then add the vcs path and license
    3. source setup.csh         //if not success you can touch a new file named setup.csh and copy the content to the new file. then source the new file
    4. cd wujian100_open/workdir
    5. if you want to use iverilog as simulation tool please execute the command '../tools/run_case -sim_tool iverilog ../case/timer/timer_test.c' or if you want to use vcs as simulation tool please execute the command '../tools/run_case -sim_tool vcs ../case/timer/timer_test.c'
# Get ready for FPGA bit generation
    1. make sure you have the synplify and license
    2. cd wujian100_open/fpga/synplify
    3. execute the synplify and load the wujian100_open_200t_3b.prj file
    4. input the command 'sdc2fdc' in synplify
    5. start the synplify
    6. after synplify generated the netlist we will use vivado for P&R and generated the bit file
    7. make sure you have the vivado and licese
    8. cd wujian100_open/fpga/vivado
    9. run tcl use file 'wujian100_open_200t_3b_prj.tcl'
    10. program the bit file to the fpga board
    11. enjoy the application development

# How to use the sdk
wujian100_open SDK is wujian100_open software development kit, the software follows the CSI interface specification. Through the SDK users can quickly wujian100_open test and evaluation. At the same time users can refer to the SDK integration of various commonly used components and sample procedures for application development quickly form a product solution.
```

```
    1. Download and install the CDK
    2. Open a project using CDK, for example open the hello project:
      projects/examples/hello_world/CDK/wj100-open-hello_world.cdkproj
    3. Build the project:
    Click "project" on the toolbar,and select "build all". After successful compilation, you will see the following:

```
