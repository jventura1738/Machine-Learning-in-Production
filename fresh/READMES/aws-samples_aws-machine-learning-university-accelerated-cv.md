## Machine Learning University: Accelerated Computer Vision Class

This repository contains __slides__, __notebooks__, and __datasets__ for the __Machine Learning University (MLU) Computer Vision__ class. Our mission is to make Machine Learning accessible to everyone. We have courses available across many topics of machine learning and believe knowledge of ML can be a key enabler for success. This class is designed to help you get started with Computer Vision, learn about widely used Machine Learning techniques and apply them to real-world problems.

## Course Overview
There are three lectures and one final project for this class.
| Lecture 1 | Lecture 2 | Lecture 3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Intro to ML | Image Datasets | Advanced CNNs: VGGNet and ResNet |
| Intro to Computer Vision | Training Neural Networks | Object Detection |
| Neural Networks | Modern CNNs: LeNet and AlexNet | Semantic Segmentation |
| Convolutional Neural Networks | Model fine-tuning | |

__Final Project:__ Practice working with a "real-world" computer vision dataset for the final project. Final project dataset is in the [data/final_project_dataset folder](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-cv/tree/master/data/final_project_dataset). For more details on the final project, check out [this notebook](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-machine-learning-university-accelerated-cv/blob/master/notebooks/MLA-CV-Lecture1-Final-Project.ipynb).
