# Welcome to Mailpile! #

## Introduction ##

Mailpile (<https://www.mailpile.is/>) is a modern, fast web-mail client
with user-friendly encryption and privacy features. The development of
Mailpile is funded by
[a large community of backers](https://www.mailpile.is/#community)
and all code related to the project is and will be released under an OSI
approved Free Software license.

Mailpile places great emphasis on providing a clean, elegant user
interface and pleasant user experience. In particular, Mailpile aims to
make it easy and convenient to receive and send PGP encrypted or signed
e-mail.

Mailpile's primary user interface is web-based, but it also has a basic
command-line interface and an API for developers. Using web technology
for the interface allows Mailpile to function both as a local desktop
application (accessed by visiting `localhost` in the browser) or a
remote web-mail on a personal server or VPS.

The core of Mailpile is a fast search engine, custom written to deal
with large volumes of e-mail on consumer hardware. The search engine
allows e-mail to be organized using tags (similar to GMail's labels) and
the application can be configured to automatically tag incoming mail
either based on static rules or bayesian classifiers.

**Note:** We are currently working towards a 1.0 release candidate. Until
it is ready, Mailpile is really only suitable for developers who can help
us find and fix the last few bugs. Our beta releases are obsolete and
**should not be used**, in part for security reasons! For more details

or [read our blog](https://www.mailpile.is/blog/).


### Trying Mailpile

We have live demos up and running [on our
website](https://www.mailpile.is/demos/). If you are curious about what
Mailpile looks like, please feel free to check it out.


### Installing Mailpile

Note that Mailpile is still in development and is not suitable for
production or end-user use. However, developers and early adopters are
encouraged to give it a try and even help us find bugs, fix them and
develop new features.

Bjarni R. Einarsson (<http://bre.klaki.net/>) created this!  If you
think it's neat, you should also check out PageKite:
<https://pagekite.net/>. [Sm√°ri](<http://www.smarimccarthy.is/>) and
[Brennan](https://brennannovak.com) joined the team in 2013 and made
this a real project (not just a toy search engine).

The original GMail team deserve a mention for their inspiring work:
wishing the Free Software world had something like GMail is what
motivated Bjarni to start working on Mailpile. We would also like to
thank Edward Snowden for inspiring us to try and make PGP usable for
journalists and everday folks!
