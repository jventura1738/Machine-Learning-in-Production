Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software
that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected
data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly
optimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from
the open-source community.

For more, please visit the [Open3D documentation](http://www.open3d.org/docs).

## Python quick start

Pre-built pip and conda packages support Ubuntu 18.04+, macOS 10.14+ and
Windows 10 (64-bit) with Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

```bash
# Install Open3D stable release with pip (including in conda virtual environments)
$ pip install open3d

# Test the installation
$ python -c "import open3d as o3d; print(o3d)"

```

To get the latest features in Open3D, install the
[development pip package](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/getting_started.html#development-version-pip).
To compile Open3D from source, refer to
[compiling from source](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/compilation.html).

## C++ quick start

Open3D-Viewer is a standalone 3D viewer app available on Ubuntu and macOS.
Please stay tuned for Windows. Download Open3D Viewer from the
[release page](https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D/releases).

## Open3D-ML

Open3D-ML is an extension of Open3D for 3D machine learning tasks. It builds on
top of the Open3D core library and extends it with machine learning tools for
3D data processing. To try it out, install Open3D with PyTorch or TensorFlow and check out
[Open3D-ML](https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D-ML).
