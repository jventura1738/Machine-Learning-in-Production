Pyston is a faster and highly-compatible implementation of the Python programming language.
This is the old repository for Pyston v1, which has been superseded by [Pyston v2](https://github.com/pyston/pyston)

To reduce confusion this repository is kept empty, but if you want to see our old v1 code it is all under the [v1.0 tag](https://github.com/pyston/pyston_v1/tree/v1.0) in this repository.

For updates, please follow [our blog](https://blog.pyston.org/)
