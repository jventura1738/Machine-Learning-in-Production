# Z shell configuration

We use Z shell extensively, on many kinds of systems. We use a Z shell configuration and directory naming conventions that help with compatibility, flexibility, and portability. This repo describes our conventions and has our typical starter setup for Z shell aliases, functions, settings, etc. In practice this works well with other Z shell tools, such as oh-my-zsh.

## zsh startup files

There are five startup files that zsh will read commands from in order:

```zsh
zshenv
zprofile
zshrc
zlogin
zlogout
```

Below, we explain more about each of these files, when it is loaded, and what it does.


### zsh locations

The default location for zsh system files:

```zsh
/etc/zshenv
/etc/zprofile
/etc/zshrc
/etc/zlogin
/etc/zlogout
```

The default location for zsh user files:

```zsh
$HOME/.zshenv
$HOME/.zprofile
$HOME/.zshrc
$HOME/.zlogin
$HOME/.zlogout
```

The convention is to use corresponding directories with names that end in `.d` such as `$HOME/zshenv.d`.


### zsh loading

To make zsh load everything we want, we edit each of our user zsh files, and add a load script.

Edit `$HOME/.zshenv` and add:

```zsh
for f in /etc/zshenv{,.d/**/*}(.N) $HOME/.zshenv.d/**/*(.N); do . "$f"; done
```

Edit each of the rest of the user zsh files, and add a corresponding load script.


## zsh startup files: when they load and what they do


### zshenv

`zshenv` is sourced on all invocations of the shell, unless the -f option is set.

What goes in it:

  * Set up the command search path

  * Other important environment variables

  * Commands to set up aliases and functions that are needed for other scripts

What does NOT go in it:

  * Commands that produce output

  * Anything that assumes the shell is attached to a tty


### zprofile

`zprofile` is sourced in login shells. It is meant as an alternative to `zlogin` for `ksh` fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if desired.

What goes in it:

  * Commands that should be executed only in login shells.

  * As a general rule, it should not change the shell environment at all.

  * As a general rule, set the terminal type then run a series of external commands e.g. fortune, msgs, etc.

What does NOT go in it:

  * Alias definitions

  * Function definitions

  * Options

  * Environment variable settings


### zshrc

`zshrc` is sourced in interactive shells.

What goes in it:

  * Commands to set up aliases, functions, options, key bindings, for interactive use etc.


### zlogin

`zlogin` is like `zprofile`, except sourced after zshrc.


### zlogout

`zlogout` is sourced when login shells exit.


### extras

Some zsh setups provide more files that are not read by zsh:

  * `.zsh-update`: contains a timestamp of the most recent update

  * `.zshrc-e`: an example file; the Z shell convention is example files end in `-e`.


## Repo files

This repo contains our Z shell conventions for subdirectories and also our files that we like to use with multiple teams.

Notable subdirectories:

  * `zshenv.d/functions` is for functions.

  * `zshenv.d/programs` is for configuring environment programs via environment variables, such as `$EDITOR`, `$PAGER`, etc.

  * `zshenv.d/settings` is for Z shell settings, such as for completion, history, etc.

  * `zshrc.d/aliases` is for aliases, such as `g` for `git`, `now` for printing the current time, etc.


### Conventions

Alias conventions:

  * For an alias that is a one-letter shortcut, we use a naming convention for the file: the letter, an equal sign, and the result. For example, the file `g=git.zsh` is the alias that sets `g` to run `git`.

  * For an alias that is intended to launch a program, we use a convention of trying probable locations for the tool. For example, for the alias `firefox`, we look in order in `/opt` (e.g. typical for our custom installs), then on the path, then in the typical macOS location.


Environment program conventions:

  * `$EDITOR` for editing text files, such as `vi` or `emacs`.

  * `$PAGER` for showing text files, such as `more` or `less`.
  
  * `$FINDER` for searching text files, such as `grep` or `rg`.

  * `$CLIPPER` for copying text to a clipboard, such as `xclip` or `pbcopy`.
  
  * `$DATER` for showing dates and times, such as `date` or `gdate`.

  * `$JUMPER` for moving among directories, such as `jump` or `jumpdir`.


Date/time format conventions:  

  * We default to nanoseconds precision (not seconds precision), because we use subsecond precision on some of our systems.

  * We default to UTC timezone and the format "+00:00" (not "Z"), because this maximizes our compatibility with fintech systems and logs.



### Install

Clone:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/sixarm/sixarm_zsh_config
```

Move the directories and files as you like, to wherever you want.

For example, to copy all the files into your user directories:

```zsh
cd sixarm_zsh_etc_files
cp -R zshenv.d/* $HOME/.zshenv.d
cp -R zprofile.d/* $HOME/.zprofile.d
cp -R zshrc.d/* $HOME/.zshrc.d
cp -R zlogin.d/* $HOME/.zlogin.d
cp -R zlogout.d/* $HOME/.zlogout.d
```


### Install system-wide

We prefer to install system-wide, making the repo files generally available for all system users.

We save the repo in our preferred directory `/opt`:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/sixarm/sixarm_zsh_config /opt/sixarm/sixarm_zsh_config
```

Any system user can edit their own zsh files in order to source the repo files.

Example: you can edit your user file `~/.zshev` to add this line near the top:

```zsh
for file in \
        /etc/environment \
        /etc/environment.d(.N) \
        /etc/zsh/zshenv \
        /etc/zsh/zshenv.d/**/*.zsh(.N) \
        /opt/sixarm_zsh_config/zshenv.d/**/*.zsh(.N) \
        $HOME/.config/zshenv.d/**/*.zsh(.N) \
; do
    if [ -f "$file" ] && [ -r "$file" ] && [ -s "$file" ]; then
        . "$file"
    fi
done
```

Example: you can edit your user file `~/.zshrc` to add this line near the top:

```zsh
for file in \
        /opt/sixarm_zsh_config/zshenv.d/**/*.zsh(N) \
        $HOME/.config/zshenv.d/**/*.zsh(N) \
; do
    if [ -f "$file" ] && [ -r "$file" ] && [ -s "$file" ]; then
        . "$file"
    fi
done
```
