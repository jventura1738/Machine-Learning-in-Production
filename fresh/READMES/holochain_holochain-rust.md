This code is loosely based on the previous [Golang prototype](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto).

**Code Status:** This Rust version is alpha software -- not for production use. You should expect unstable code APIs and data chains.

**NO LONGER CURRENT REPOSITORY:** This version of Holochain has been replaced by a version that is more performant, stable, and secure. We suggest porting applications to **the [new version of Holochain](https://github.com/holochain/holochain)** which is receiving regular updates and feature enhancements.
