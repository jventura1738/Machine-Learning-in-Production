[Arguman.org](https://arguman.org) is an argument analysis and [mapping](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Argument_map) platform.

## How does it work

Users assert contentions to be discussed, supported, proved, or disproved, and argue with premises using because, but, or however conjunctions.

## Benefits

Critical thinking is the intellectually-disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication as a guide to belief and action. In its exemplary form, it is based on universal intellectual values that transcend subject matter divisions: clarity, accuracy, precision, consistency, relevance, sound evidence, good reasons, depth, breadth, and fairness.

Basis of critical thinking is arguments. Assessment is done over argument, argument premises, promotives, and corruptives.

You can think of argument mappings as visual hierarchy mappings.

Arguman.org’s aim is to map arguments successfully through the efforts of many users.
