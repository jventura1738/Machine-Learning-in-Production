# Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

This repository contains open-source libraries and tools to perform fully
homomorphic encryption (FHE) operations on an encrypted data set.

**About Fully Homomorphic Encryption**

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is an emerging data processing paradigm that
allows developers to perform transformations on encrypted data. FHE can change
the way computations are performed by preserving privacy end-to-end, thereby
giving users even greater confidence that their information will remain private
and secure.

## FHE C++ Transpiler

The FHE C++ Transpiler is a general purpose library that converts C++ into
FHE-C++ that works on encrypted input. The code, examples, and more information
is in the [`transpiler`](./transpiler/) subdirectory.

## Support

We will continue to publish updates and improvements to the FHE library. We are
not yet accepting external contributions to this project. We will respond to
issues filed in this project. If we ever intend to stop publishing improvements
and responding to issues we will publish notice here at least 3 months in
advance.
