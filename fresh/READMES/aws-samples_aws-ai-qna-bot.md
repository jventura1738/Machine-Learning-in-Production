# A Question and Answer Bot Using Amazon Lex and Amazon Alexa

> Build a chat bot to answer questions.

## Overview

This repository contains code for the QnABot, described in the AWS AI blog post [“Creating a Question and Answer Bot with Amazon Lex and Amazon Alexa”](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/creating-a-question-and-answer-bot-with-amazon-lex-and-amazon-alexa/).

See the "Getting Started" to launch your own QnABot.

**See all the new features list for 4.7.1** [Lex V2 Elicit response bots, Config import/export](#new-features)

4.7.1 provides performance improvements and component upgrades
  - Amazon Elasticsearch version 7.10 is now utilized.
  - Encrypted Elasticsearch (production) instance types now use m6g.large.elasticsearch for improved price/performance/memory. 
  - The QnABot fulfillment Lambda function has been optimized to reduce query response times and variability, 
    especially after periods of inactivity. 
  - LexV2 built-in Elicit Response bots have been added. 
  - Custom settings can now be exported and imported from the Content Designer Settings page.
  - Bug fix when ES_SCORE_ANSWER_FIELD is set to true. Prior to this fix, answer fields were not
    utilized fully in Elasticsearch queries.

4.7.0 QnABot now supports LexV2 with voice interaction in multiple languages.
  - Two installation/update modes are now available:
    - (i) LexV1 + LexV2 (default, recommended for most AWS regions.
    - (ii) LexV2-only (currently recommended for AWS regions where LexV1 is not available).
  
4.6.0 provides a number of new features described below. Several to call attention to are the following:

- Kendra custom no_hits item required in earlier releases is no longer required to enable Kendra Fallback and should be removed, configurable confidence thresholds now available for filtering Kendra results.
- Kendra integration is now fully automated during install or update when the new default Kendra Index Id parameter is provided.
- Standard markdown is now automatically converted to Slack markdown when using Slack, Kibana dashboard logs and metrics retention period is now configurable during install or update, Lambda runtime upgraded to Node.js 12.x.

**New features in 4.6.0** [Improved Kendra integration and Kibana dashboards. Additional settings to filter Kendra responses based on confidence levels](#new-features)

**New features in 4.5.0** [Kendra Web Crawler, Comprehend PII Detection, Translate Custom Terminology, Increased deployment regions](#new-features)

## Upgrade Notes

During an upgrade, we recommend that existing QnABot content first be exported and downloaded from the Content Designer prior to
the upgrade. In this release we expect upgrade to be smooth but just in case you should always have your QnABot content preserved.

## Prerequisites

- Run Linux. (tested on Amazon Linux)
- Install npm >7.10.0 and node >12.15.1. ([instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

### Clone the git repo and build a version

First, install all prerequisites:

```shell
npm install 
```

Next, set up your configuration file:

```shell
npm run config
```

now edit config.json with you information.

| param | description |
|-------|-------------|
|region | the AWS region to launch stacks in |
|profile| the AWS credential profile to use |
|namespace| a logical name space to run your templates in such as dev, test and/or prod |
|devEmail(required) | the email to use when creating admin users in automated stack launches |

Next, use the following command to launch a CloudFormation template to create the S3 bucket to be used for lambda code and CloudFormation templates. Wait for this template to complete (you can watch progress from the command line or [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.AWS.amazon.com/cloudformation/home))  

```shell
npm run bootstrap
```

Finally, use the following command to launch template to deploy the QnA bot in your AWS account. When the stack has completed you will be able to log into the Designer UI (The URL is an output of the template). A temporary password to the email in your config.json:

```shell
npm run up
```

If you have an existing stack you can run the following to update your stack:

```shell
npm run update
```

These are Northern Virginia (us-east-1), Oregon (us-west-2),  Ireland (eu-west-1), London (eu-west-2), Frankfurt (eu-central-1), Sydney (ap-southeast-2), Singapore (ap-southeast-1), and Tokyo (ap-northeast-1).

A [workshop](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ai-qna-bot/tree/master/workshops/reinvent2019/readme.md) is available in GitHub
that will walk you through setting up this feature.
