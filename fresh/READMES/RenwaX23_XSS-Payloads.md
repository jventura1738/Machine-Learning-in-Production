# XSS-Payloads
# [XSS-Payloads Without Parentheses](https://github.com/RenwaX23/XSS-Payloads/blob/master/Without-Parentheses.md)
List of XSS Vectors/Payloads i have been collecting since 2015 from different resources like websites,tweets,books..

You can use them to bypass WAF and find XSS vulnerabilities, i will try to update the list as possible.

I collected most of them and they have real authors, i can't remember where i got each one of them so i can give credit sorry. If you own any payload want to be mentioned or removed just ping me on Twitter.

**Payloads.txt** is no longer updated and most of the payloads are outdated, please refer to [PORTSWIGGER XSS cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet) for best XSS payloads
