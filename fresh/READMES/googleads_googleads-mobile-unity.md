# Google Mobile Ads Unity Plugin

The Google Mobile Ads SDK is the latest generation in Google mobile advertising
featuring refined ad formats and streamlined APIs for access to mobile ad
networks and advertising solutions. The SDK enables mobile app developers to
maximize their monetization in native mobile apps.

This repository contains the source code for the Google Mobile Ads Unity
plugin. This plugin enables Unity developers to easily serve Google Mobile Ads
on Android and iOS apps without having to write Java or Objective-C code.
The plugin provides a C# interface for requesting ads that is used by C#
scripts in your Unity project.
