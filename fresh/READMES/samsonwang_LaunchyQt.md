I have been using Launchy for years, and found that this project has not been updated since 2010. I love this tool and want to maintain this project.

** Improvemenets
Compared to the old one, LaunchyQt offers more as follows:

- Locale language indexing support, such as simplified Chinese pinyin.
- Built-in python support, develop plugins in python painlessly.
- Python package management with pip, more easy to install 3rd-party packages.
