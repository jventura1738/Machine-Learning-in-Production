This repository contains all of the code and software labs for [MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com)! All lecture slides and videos are available on the course website.


## Opening the labs in Google Colaboratory:

The 2021 6.S191 labs will be run in Google's Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud, you don't need to download anything. To run these labs, you must have a Google account.

On this Github repo, navigate to the lab folder you want to run (`lab1`, `lab2`, `lab3`) and open the appropriate python notebook (\*.ipynb). Click the "Run in Colab" link on the top of the lab. That's it!

## Running the labs
Now, to run the labs, open the Jupyter notebook on Colab. Navigate to the "Runtime" tab --> "Change runtime type". In the pop-up window, under "Runtime type" select "Python 3", and under "Hardware accelerator" select "GPU". Go through the notebooks and fill in the `#TODO` cells to get the code to compile for yourself!


### MIT Deep Learning package
You might notice that inside the labs we install the `mitdeeplearning` python package from the Python Package repository:

`pip install mitdeeplearning`

This package contains convienence functions that we use throughout the course and can be imported like any other Python package.

`>>> import mitdeeplearning as mdl`

We do this for you in each of the labs, but the package is also open source under the same license so you can also use it outside the class.
