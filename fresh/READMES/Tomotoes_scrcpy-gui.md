## üí°Introduction

[Scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) was created by the team behind the popular Android emulator Genymotion, but it is not an Android emulator itself, it displays and controls Android devices connected via USB or TCP/IP, it does not require any root access. It works with GNU/Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

Scrcpy works by running a server on your Android device, and the desktop application communicates using USB (or using ADB tunneling wireless). The server streams the H.264 video of the device screen. The client decodes the video frames and displays them. The client captures input (keyboard and mouse) events, sends them to the server, and the server injects them into the device. [The documentation](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/DEVELOP.md) provides more details.

If you want to see your Android screen interact with the app or content on your desktop, record your phone screen or perform other basic tasks, then Scrcpy is a good choice.

In short, Scrcpy is an excellent way to easily view your Android screen on your computer and interact with it in real time.

## üåûRequirements

1. The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

2. Make sure you [enabled adb debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling) on your device(s).

   On some devices, you also need to enable [an additional option](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/issues/70#issuecomment-373286323) to control it using keyboard and mouse.

3. Install scrcpy and configure environment variables

   - Linux

     On Linux, you typically need to [build the app manually](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md). Don't worry, it's not that hard.

     A [Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager)) package is available: [`scrcpy`](https://snapstats.org/snaps/scrcpy).

     For Arch Linux, an [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository) package is available: [`scrcpy`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/scrcpy/).

     For Gentoo, an [Ebuild](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Ebuild) is available: [`scrcpy/`](https://github.com/maggu2810/maggu2810-overlay/tree/master/app-mobilephone/scrcpy).

   - Windows

     For Windows, for simplicity, prebuilt archives with all the dependencies (including `adb`) are available:

     - [`scrcpy-win32-v1.10.zip`](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/download/v1.10/scrcpy-win32-v1.10.zip)
       *(SHA-256: f98b400b3764404b33b212e9762dd6f1593ddb766c1480fc2609c94768e4a8e1)*
     - [`scrcpy-win64-v1.10.zip`](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases/download/v1.10/scrcpy-win64-v1.10.zip)
       *(SHA-256: 95de34575d873c7e95dfcfb5e74d0f6af4f70b2a5bc6fde0f48d1a05480e3a44)*

     You can also [build the app manually](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md).

   - macOS

     The application is available in [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Just install it:

     ```
     brew install scrcpy
     ```

     You need `adb`, accessible from your `PATH`. If you don't have it yet:

     ```
     brew cask install android-platform-tools
     ```

     You can also [build the app manually](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/BUILD.md).
