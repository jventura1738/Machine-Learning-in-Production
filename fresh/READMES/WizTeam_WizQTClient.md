## Introduction

The project is based on Qt, aimed to provide an excellent PKM(personal knowledge management) desktop environment based on cloud usage. At present, we only have Wiz cloud backend(our company) on the table. but we strong encourage developers to contribute to this project to add more cloud backend for different cloud providers like evernote, youdao, etc...even offline usage.

PKM should be an very important thing cross through one person's life, it's unwise to stick yourself to a fixed service provider or jump around and leave your collected info/secrets behide. PKM should be the same as your mind, fly over the ocean but never splash the waves.

freedom, means knowledge, means PKM, means this WizNote client.

if you are windows or portable platform users, we have WizNote for windows, ios, android from our [Homepage](http://www.wiznote.com)
