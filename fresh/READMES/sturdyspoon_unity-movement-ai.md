# Unity Movement AI
**Unity Movement AI** is a library of common movement AI scripts known as Steering Behaviors. You can use these scripts to help your NPCs move around your game.

# How to Use
If you want to add this library to your game then import the [**UnityMovementAI.unitypackage**](https://github.com/antonpantev/unity-movement-ai/raw/master/UnityMovementAI.unitypackage). This package includes all of the movement scripts along with some premade game objects that use the scripts. 

Feel free to only use what you need from the package.

# Examples
If you would like to play around with the library then download this whole repository and open it in Unity. The **Examples** folder holds a number of premade scenes for you to play around with.

# Additional Info
The library comes with the following steering behaviors:
`Arrive`, `Cohesion`, `Collision Avoidance`, `Evade`, `Flee`, `Follow Path`, `Hide`, `Interpose`, `Offset Pursuit`, `Pursue`, `Seek`, `Separation`, `Velocity Match`, `Wall Avoidance`, and `Wander`.

Most steering behaviors have their own file, but `Arrive`, `Interpose`, and `Seek` are all located within the **SteeringBasics.cs** file.
