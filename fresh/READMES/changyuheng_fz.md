## Demo

## Installation

By simply sourcing corresponding script file for your shell, you're all set.
However, this plugin is sitting on top of [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) and
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), so you must have them installed as well.

N.B. `fz` needs to be sourced after `z`.

### macOS

#### Bash

1. Install fzf via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

    ```sh
    brew install fzf

    curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rupa/z/master/{z.sh}" \
        -o ~/.bash_completion.d/"#1"
    curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/changyuheng/fz/master/{fz.sh}" \
        -o ~/.bash_completion.d/z"#1"
    ```

3. Add the following content to `~/.bashrc`:

    ```sh
    if [ -d ~/.bash_completion.d ]; then
      for file in ~/.bash_completion.d/*; do
        . $file
      done
    fi
    ```

#### zsh

    curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/changyuheng/fz/master/{fz.sh}" \
        -o ~/.bash_completion.d/z"#1"
    ```

    Add the following content to `~/.zshrc`:

    ```sh
    zplug "changyuheng/fz", defer:1
    zplug "rupa/z", use:z.sh
    ```

## Usage

```
z [dir name slug]<TAB>
zz [dir name slug]<TAB>
```

- The function of fz is pretty much like what it is of
    [z](https://github.com/rupa/z).
    `zz` limits the search base starting from current working directory.
    Check z’s doc for more information.
- `tab`/`shift-tab`, `ctrl-n`/`ctrl-p`, `ctrl-j`/`ctrl-k`,
    for next and previous item. `Enter` for selection.
    Check fzf’s [doc](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#search-syntax)
    for the search syntaxes.
- `FZ_CMD=z` specifies command name of `fz`. Default is `z`.
- `FZ_SUBDIR_CMD=zz` specifies command name for subdirectory only `z`.
    Default is `zz`.
- `FZ_SUBDIR_TRAVERSAL=0` disables subdirectory completion.
    Default is enabled.
- `FZ_CASE_INSENSITIVE=0` disables case-insensitive subdirectory completion.
    Default is enabled.
- `FZ_ABBREVIATE_HOME=0` disables abbreviating `~`.  Default is enabled.
- `FZ_HISTORY_CD_CMD=_zlua` works with [z.lua](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua).
