Yii 2.0 Community Cookbook
==========================

This repository hosts an OpenSource book full of tips and tricks about [Yii 2.0](http://www.yiiframework.com/) PHP framework.

![Cover](book/images/cover.jpg)

[Here's the table of contents](https://github.com/samdark/yii2-cookbook/blob/master/book/README.md).

> Note: it's not the same book as [Yii2 Application Development Cookbook - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/yii2-application-development-cookbook-third-edition) published by PACKT.

The book is created [by Yii community](https://github.com/samdark/yii2-cookbook/graphs/contributors) and edited by Alexander Makarov ([@samdark](https://github.com/samdark)), a core team member of the framework.

Feel free to pull request your own writings. I'll review it, provide feedback and merge the best possible way.
