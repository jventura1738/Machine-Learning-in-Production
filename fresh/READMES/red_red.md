Red Programming Language
------------------------

**Red** is a new programming language strongly inspired by [Rebol](http://rebol.com), but with a broader field of usage thanks to its native-code compiler, from system programming to high-level scripting, while providing modern support for concurrency and multi-core CPUs.

Red has its own complete cross-platform toolchain, featuring two compilers, an interpreter, and a linker, not depending on any third-party library, except for a Rebol2 interpreter, required during the bootstrap phase. Once complete, Red will be [self-hosted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting).

The Red software stack also contains another language, **Red/System**, which is a low-level dialect of Red. It is a limited C-level language with a Red look'n' feel, required to build Red's runtime library and be the target language of Red's compiler. More information at [red-lang.org](http://www.red-lang.org).

Making a Red "Hello World"
------------------------
The Red toolchain comes as a single **one-megabyte** executable file that you can download from [here](http://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) for the big-3 platforms.

1. Put the downloaded **red** binary in the working folder.

2. In a code or text editor, write the following Hello World program:

        Red [
            Title: "Simple hello world script"
        ]

        print "Hello World!"

3. Save it under the name: **hello.red**

4. From a terminal (works from DOS too), run it with:

        $ red hello.red

5. You should see the _Hello World!_ output.

6. Want to generate a compiled executable from that program?

        $ red -c hello.red
        $ ./hello

7. Want to generate a compiled executable from that program with no dependencies?

        $ red -r hello.red
        $ ./hello

8. Want to cross-compile to another supported platform?

        $ red -t Windows hello.red
        $ red -t Darwin hello.red
        $ red -t Linux-ARM hello.red

**The command-line syntax is:**

    red [command] [options] [file]

`[file]` any Red or Red/System source file. If no file and no option is provided, the graphical interactive console will be launched. If a file with no option is provided, the file will be simply run by the interpreter (it is expected to be a Red script with no Red/System code).

Note: On Non-Windows platforms, the REPL runs by default in CLI mode. But on Windows, the default is to run in GUI mode. To run it in the command line mode, invoke the red binary with the option `--cli`.

`[options]`

    -c, --compile                  : Generate an executable in the working
                                     folder, using libRedRT. (development mode)

    -d, --debug, --debug-stabs     : Compile source file in debug mode. STABS
                                     is supported for Linux targets.

                                     file.

    -e, --encap                    : Compile in encap mode, so code is interpreted
                                     at runtime. Avoids compiler issues. Required
                                     for some dynamic code.

    -h, --help                     : Output this help text.

    -o <file>, --output <file>     : Specify a non-default [path/][name] for
                                     the generated binary file.

    -r, --release                  : Compile in release mode, linking everything
                                     together (default: development mode).

                                      (only for Red scripts with R/S code).

    -v <level>, --verbose <level>  : Set compilation verbosity level, 1-3 for
                                     Red, 4-11 for Red/System.

    -V, --version                  : Output Red's executable version in x.y.z
                                     format.

_Note_: Running the Red toolchain binary from a $PATH currently requires a wrapping shell script (see relevant tickets: [#543](https://github.com/red/red/issues/543) and [#1547](https://github.com/red/red/issues/1547)).

Running the Red REPL
-----------------------

1. Just run the `red` binary with no option to access the [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

        ---== Red 0.6.3 ==--
        Type HELP for starting information.

        >>

1. You can use it to test rapidly some Red code:

        >> 1 + 2
        == 3

        >> inc: func [n][n + 1]
        == func [n][n + 1]

        >> inc 123
        == 124


Notes:

- On Windows, the REPL runs by default in GUI mode. To run it in the command line, invoke the red binary as `red --cli`.
- Wine has some [issues](https://github.com/red/red/issues/1618) with the GUI-Console. Install the `Consolas` font to fix the problem.


Running Red from the sources (for contributors)
------------------------
The compiler and linker are currently written in Rebol. Please follow the instructions for installing the compiler toolchain in order to run it from sources:

1. Clone this git repository or download an archive (`ZIP` button above or from [tagged packages](https://github.com/red/red/tags)).

1. Download a Rebol interpreter suitable for your OS: [Windows](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-3-1.exe), [Linux](http://www.maxvessi.net/rebsite/Linux/) (or [Linux](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-4-2.tar.gz)), [Mac OS X](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-2-5.tar.gz), [FreeBSD](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-7-2.tar.gz), [OpenBSD](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v278/rebol-core-278-9-4.tar.gz), [Solaris](http://www.rebol.com/downloads/v276/rebol-core-276-10-1.gz).

1. Extract the `rebol` binary, put it in the root folder, that's all!

1. Let's test it: run `./rebol`, you'll see a `>>` prompt appear. Windows users need to double-click on the `rebol.exe` file to run it.

1. From the REBOL console type:

        >> do/args %red.r "%tests/hello.red"

The compilation process should finish with a `...output file size` message. The resulting binary is in the working folder. Windows users need to open a DOS console and run `hello.exe` from there.

To see the intermediary Red/System code generated by the compiler, use:

        >> do/args %red.r "-v 2 %tests/hello.red"

You can also compile the Red console from source:

        >> do/args %red.r "-r %environment/console/CLI/console.red"

To compile the Windows GUI console from source:

        >> do/args %red.r "-r -t Windows %environment/console/GUI/gui-console.red"

Note: the `-c` argument is not necessary when launching the Red toolchain from sources, as the default action is to compile the input script (the toolchain in binary form default action is to run the input script through the interpreter).
The `-r` argument is needed when compiling the Red console to make additional runtime functions available.

Note: The red git repository does not include a `.gitignore` file. If you run the automated tests, several files will be created that are not stored in the repository. Installing and renaming a copy of [`.gitignore-sample`](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/.gitignore-sample) file will ignore these generated files.

Contributing
-------------------------
If you want to contribute code to the Red project be sure to read the [guidelines](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BDOC%5D-Contributor-Guidelines) first.

It is usually a good idea to inform the Red team about what changes you are going to make in order to ensure that someone is not already working on the same thing. You can reach us through our [chat room](https://gitter.im/red/red).

Satisfied with the results of your change and want to issue a pull request on Github?

Make sure the changes pass all the existing tests, add relevant tests to the test-suite, and please test on as many platforms as you can. You can run all the tests using (from Rebol console, at repository root):

        >> do %run-all.r

Git integration with console built from sources
-------------------------
If you want git version included in your Red console built from sources, use this command:
```Red
call/show ""                                              ;-- patch call bug on Windows
save %build/git.r do %build/git-version.r                 ;-- lookup git version if available
do/args %red.r "-r %environment/console/CLI/console.red"  ;-- build Console
write %build/git.r "none^/"                               ;-- restore git repo status
```

Anti-virus false positive
-------------------------
Some anti-virus programs are a bit too sensitive and can wrongly report an alert on some binaries generated by Red (see [here](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/%5BNOTE%5D-Anti-virus-false-positives) for the details). If that happens to you, please report it to your anti-virus vendor as a false positive.
