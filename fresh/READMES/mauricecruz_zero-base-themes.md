# Zero Base Themes

An assortment of Chrome Devtools themes that use the Zero Base Template.

# Contributing

Zero Base Themes is built on LESS. Grunt is used to listen for changes to LESS files and generates CSS. This means [Node](http://nodejs.org/) is required.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/mauricecruz/zero-base-themes.git`.

2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.

3.  To use an existing theme: `grunt`. (If you're going to work on your own theme: `grunt watch` to listen for changes).

4.  `Chrome > Preferences... > Extensions > DevTools Theme: Zero Dark Matrix = Enabled`

5.  chrome://flags (make sure `Enable Developer Tools experiments` is enabled).

6.  In Chrome Dev Tools > Settings (cog icon or `Shift+?`) > Experiments > Allow custom UI themes.

7.  Close and reopen the dev tools.

## Contributing to Template Source

All template files are located in the `/less` directory. Files beginning with an `_` indicate template partials. Any addition/removal of template partials should be reflected in the build file.

## Changing Themes

Copy `/themes/_theme-template.less` and modify color values accordingly. Rename the file and save in the `/themes` directory. Specify the theme of your choice in `config.less`.

# Alternatives

Chrome now has an option to let you select different themes via Settings > Appearance > Theme: Light/Dark.
