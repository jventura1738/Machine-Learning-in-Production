Kamon is a set of tools for instrumenting applications running on the JVM. The best way to get started is to go to our
official [Get Started Page](https://kamon.io/get-started/) and start instrumenting your applications right away! There
you will also find guides and reference documentation for the core APIs, instrumentation and reporting modules.

# Importing the project into Intellij IDEA
This project has a library dependency on a subproject of itself (`kamon-tapir`).
As a result of that, if you just clone this project and open it in IDEA, it will fail to import it.
First, run `sbt +kamon-tapir/publishLocal` from the console, and then IDEA will be able to import the project.

## Why is this necessary?
Among our instrumented libraries is `Tapir`, which is also the only library we instrument that does not have a scala 2.11 version. 
In order to be able to cross publish `kamon-bundle` to all scala versions, while excluding `kamon-tapir` from the 2.11 bundle, 
we had to define `kamon-tapir` as a library dependency of `kamon-bundle` (instead of as a subproject).
