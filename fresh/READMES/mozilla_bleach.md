Bleach is an allowed-list-based HTML sanitizing library that escapes or strips
markup and attributes.

Bleach can also linkify text safely, applying filters that Django's ``urlize``
filter cannot, and optionally setting ``rel`` attributes, even on links already
in the text.

Bleach is intended for sanitizing text from *untrusted* sources. If you find
yourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of
things, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or
don't.

Because it relies on html5lib_, Bleach is as good as modern browsers at dealing
with weird, quirky HTML fragments. And *any* of Bleach's methods will fix
unbalanced or mis-nested tags.

The version on GitHub_ is the most up-to-date and contains the latest bug
fixes. You can find full documentation on `ReadTheDocs`_.
