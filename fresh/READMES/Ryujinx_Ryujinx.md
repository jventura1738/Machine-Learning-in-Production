    As of May 2021, Ryujinx has been tested on nearly 3,400 titles: ~3,000 boot past menus and into gameplay, with approximately 2,100 of those being considered playable. See the compatibility list <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx-Games-List/issues" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Usage

To run this emulator, we recommend that your PC have at least 8GB of RAM; less than this amount can result in unpredictable behavior and may cause crashes or unacceptable performance.

See our [Setup & Configuration Guide](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Ryujinx-Setup-&-Configuration-Guide) on how to set up the emulator.

## Latest build

These builds are compiled automatically for each commit on the master branch. While we strive to ensure optimal stability and performance prior to pushing an update, our automated builds **may be unstable or completely broken.**

The latest automatic build for Windows, macOS, and Linux can be found on the [Official Website](https://ryujinx.org/download).

## Building

If you wish to build the emulator yourself  you will need to:

**Step one:** Install the X64 version of [.NET 5.0 (or higher) SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0).

**Step two (choose one):**  
**(Variant one)**

After the installation of the .NET SDK is done; go ahead and copy the Clone link from GitHub from here (via Clone or Download --> Copy HTTPS Link. You can Git Clone the repo by using Git Bash or Git CMD.

**(Variant two):**

Download the ZIP Tarball. Then extract it to a directory of your choice.

**Step three:**

Build the App using a Command prompt in the project directory. You can quickly access it by holding shift in explorer (in the Ryujinx directory) then right clicking, and typing the following command:  
Run `dotnet build -c Release` inside the Ryujinx project folder to build Ryujinx binaries.

Ryujinx system files are stored in the `Ryujinx` folder. This folder is located in the user folder, which can be accessed by clicking `Open Ryujinx Folder` under the File menu in the GUI.

## Features

 - **Audio**

   Audio output is entirely supported, audio input (microphone) isn't supported. We use C# wrappers for [OpenAL](https://openal-soft.org/), and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) & [libsoundio](http://libsound.io/) as fallbacks.

- **CPU**

  The CPU emulator, ARMeilleure, emulates an ARMv8 CPU and currently has support for most 64-bit ARMv8 and some of the ARMv7 (and older) instructions, including partial 32-bit support. It translates the ARM code to a custom IR, performs a few optimizations, and turns that into x86 code.  
  There are three memory manager options available depending on the user's preference, leveraging both software-based (slower) and host-mapped modes (much faster). The fastest option (host, unchecked) is set by default.
  Ryujinx also features an optional Profiled Persistent Translation Cache, which essentially caches translated functions so that they do not need to be translated every time the game loads. The net result is a significant reduction in load times (the amount of time between launching a game and arriving at the title screen) for nearly every game. NOTE: this feature is enabled by default in the Options menu > System tab. You must launch the game at least twice to the title screen or beyond before performance improvements are unlocked on the third launch! These improvements are permanent and do not require any extra launches going forward.

- **GPU**

  The GPU emulator emulates the Switch's Maxwell GPU using the OpenGL API (version 4.5 minimum) through a custom build of OpenTK. There are currently four graphics enhancements available to the end user in Ryujinx: disk shader caching, resolution scaling, aspect ratio adjustment and anisotropic filtering. These enhancements can be adjusted or toggled as desired in the GUI.

- **Input**

   We currently have support for keyboard, mouse, touch input, JoyCon input support, and nearly all controllers. Motion controls are natively supported in most cases; for dual-JoyCon motion support, DS4Windows or BetterJoy are currently required. 
   In all scenarios, you can set up everything inside the input configuration menu.

- **DLC & Modifications**

   Ryujinx is able to manage add-on content/downloadable content through the GUI. Mods (romfs, exefs, and runtime mods such as cheats) are also supported; the GUI contains a shortcut to open the respective mods folder for a particular game.

- **Configuration**

   The emulator has settings for enabling or disabling some logging, remapping controllers, and more. You can configure all of them through the graphical interface or manually through the config file, `Config.json`, found in the user folder which can be accessed by clicking `Open Ryujinx Folder` under the File menu in the GUI.

## Compatibility

You can check out the compatibility list [here](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx-Games-List/issues). Anyone is free to submit an updated test on an existing game entry; simply follow the new issue template and testing guidelines, and post as a reply to the applicable game issue.

Don't hesitate to open a new issue if a game isn't already on there!

## Help

If you are having problems launching homebrew or a particular game marked status-playable or status-ingame in our compatibility list, you can contact us through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Ryujinx). We'll take note of whatever is causing the app/game to not work, put it on the watch list and fix it at a later date.
