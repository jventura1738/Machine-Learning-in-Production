- To use it go to https://javier.xyz/img2css
- Looking for a programmatic way to do this? see https://github.com/javierbyte/base64-image-utils
- I also made a per-pixel animation experiment, see https://github.com/javierbyte/morphin

## How does it work?

This tool creates a single one pixel shadow per pixel in the source images.

## Why?

Hmm... to demonstrate the power of CSS!

And this may have other interesting applications, like creating loading screens with pixel art, display images where `<img />` tags are not allowed or supported.
