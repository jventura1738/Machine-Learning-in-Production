# [finmarketpy (formerly pythalesians)](https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy)

[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/finmarketpy)](https://pepy.tech/project/finmarketpy)

finmarketpy is a Python based library that enables you to analyze market data and also to backtest trading strategies using
a simple to use API, which has prebuilt templates for you to define backtest. Included in the library

* Prebuilt templates for backtesting trading strategies
* Display historical returns for trading strategies
* Investigate seasonality of trading strategies
* Conduct market event studies around data events
* In built calculator for risk weighting using volatility targeting
* Written in object oriented way to make code more reusable

*Contributors for the project are very much welcome, see below!*

# Merging with pythalesians
I had previously written the open source PyThalesians financial library (which has been merged with this - so can focus on maintaining
one set of libraries). This new finmarketpy library has 
* Similar functionality to the trading part of pythalesians
* Rewritten the API to make it much cleaner and easier to use, as well as having many 
new features. 
* finmarketpy requires the libraries, which I've written chartpy (for charts) and findatapy (for loading market data) to function
* By splitting up into smaller more specialised libraries, it should make it easier for contributors
* Using findatapy, you can download market data easily from Bloomberg, Quandl, Yahoo etc
* Using chartpy, you can choose to have results displayed in matplotlib, plotly or bokeh by changing single keyword!

Points to note:
* Please bear in mind at present finmarketpy is under continual development. The API is heavily documented, but we are
looking to add more general documentation.
* Uses Apache 2.0 licence

# Requirements

Major requirements
* Required: Python 3.7
* Required: pandas 1.0.5, numpy etc.
* Required: findatapy for downloading market data (https://github.com/cuemacro/findatapy)
* Required: chartpy for funky interactive plots (https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy)

# Installation

For detailed installation instructions for finmarketpy and its associated Python libraries go to
https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy/blob/master/INSTALL.md (which includes details on how to setup your entire Python environment).

Also take a look at https://github.com/cuemacro/teaching/blob/master/pythoncourse/installation/installing_anaconda_and_pycharm.ipynb
from my Python for finance workshop course, where I keep notes specifically about setting up your Anaconda environment 
for data science (including for findatapy/chartpy/finmarketpy), including YAML files etc.

You can install the library using the below (better to get the newest version from repo, as opposed to releases).

After installation:
* Make sure you edit the marketconstants.py file (or you can create a marketcred.py file to overwrite the settings)

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy.git
```

But beforehand please make sure you have already installed both chartpy, findatapy and any other dependencies. 
In chartpy you will need to change the chartconstants.py file (to add Plotly API key) and 
for findatapy, you will also need to change the dataconstants.py file to add the Quandl API 
(and possibly change other configuration settings there or add a datacred.py file in the util folder, 
alternatively you will be prompted on your first run to input the API key which will be installed). If you do pip with git 
you'll get the very latest commit.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cuemacro/chartpy.git
pip install git+https://github.com/cuemacro/findatapy.git
```

However you can also pip install to get from PyPI (might be a slighter older verison from that on GitHub)

```
pip install chartpy
pip install findatapy
```

Note that if you use the option pricing/total returns you might need to get the latest FinancePy version from GitHub
https://github.com/domokane/FinancePy/ as opposed to PyPI 

```
pip install git+https://github.com/domokane/FinancePy/FinancePy.git

```

# Binder and Jupyter - Run finmarketpy in your browser

You can run some of the Jupyter notebooks in Binder interactively in your browser to play around with finmarketpy. It might take a few minutes for the 
Binder instance to start. We are currently working on having more notebooks in Binder, so stay tuned!

Note that you will need to get a Quandl
API key to download market data to use some of these, and you can sign up for a free account at https://www.quandl.com.

# Synchronizing your fork of finmarketpy with master

I found this [article useful](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository) for 
explaining how to update your fork to match the master changes.
