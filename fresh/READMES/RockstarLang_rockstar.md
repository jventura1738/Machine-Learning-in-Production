# Rockstar

Rockstar is a dynamically typed computer programming language, designed for creating programs that are also song lyrics. Rockstar is heavily influenced by the lyrical conventions of 1980s hard rock and power ballads.

### But why?

Mainly because if we make Rockstar a real (and completely pointless) programming language, then recruiters and hiring managers won't be able to talk about 'rockstar developers' any more.

Also 'cos it's kinda fun and any language based on the idea of compiling Meatloaf lyrics has to be worth a look, right?

Plus we can make stickers. Who doesn't want a sticker on their laptop saying 'CERTIFIED ROCKSTAR DEVELOPER'?

## What's here?

* The [Rockstar language specification](spec.md)
* How to [contribute to Rockstar](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Some [examples of Rockstar programs](examples/README.md)

## Implementations

The official reference implementation is [Satriani](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar/tree/master/satriani) - written in JavaScript, it runs in browsers and supports NodeJS for server-side and larger projects.

[Rocky](https://github.com/gaborsch/rocky) is a fully spec-compliant Rockstar implementation written in Java, and is currently the only Rockstar implementation that includes support for the DEC64 numeric type that was described in the original language specification.
