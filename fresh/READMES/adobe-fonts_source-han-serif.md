# Source Han Serif

Source Han Serif is a set of OpenType/CFF Pan-CJK fonts. In addition to functional OpenType fonts, this open source project provides all of the source files that were used to build these OpenType fonts by using the AFDKO *makeotf* and *otf2otc* tools.

## Download the fonts (OTF, OTC, Super OTC, Subset OTF)

Individual font resources or ZIP files for various deployment configurations are available for download:

## Building the fonts from source

### Requirements

To build the binary font files from source, you need to have installed the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) (AFDKO). The AFDKO tools are widely used for font development today, and are part of most font editor applications.

### Build all fonts

In this repository, all necessary files are in place for building the OpenType/CFF and OpenType/CFF Collection fonts. The [COMMANDS.txt](COMMANDS.txt) file provides the command lines that are used to build the OTFs and OTCs.
