### Browser support
As of version 8, the mmenu.js plugin only supports [ECMAScript 6 compliant browsers](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).<br />
For Internet Explorer 10 and 11, you''ll need [some polyfills](https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=default%2CElement.prototype.matches%2CElement.prototype.prepend%2CElement.prototype.closest).<br />
[Version 7](https://github.com/FrDH/jQuery.mmenu/releases/tag/v7.2.2) should work to some degree in Internet Explorer 9, but you'll need a [matchMedia polyfill](https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=default%2CmatchMedia),
[version 6](https://github.com/FrDH/jQuery.mmenu/releases/tag/v6.1.8) should work in Internet Explorer 9 without any shortcomings.</p>

### Development
This project uses [Gulp(4)](http://gulpjs.com/) to compile, minify and concatenate the TS/JS and SCSS/CSS files.
If you are unfamiliar with Gulp, check [this tutorial](https://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp) on how to get started.<br />
Run `gulp watch` in the command-line to put a watch on the files and run all scripts immediately after saving your changes.
