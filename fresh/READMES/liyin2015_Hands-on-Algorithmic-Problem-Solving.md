## About this book
In short, this is a middle-to-high level algorithm book designed with cracking coding interviews at hearts. It offers a one-stop coding interview prep experience. The structure of the book: (1) math and CS theories as coding is not just code after all, (2) Python data structures, (3) algorithm design principles, (4) Classical algorithms explained with core principles. (5) Problem patterns.

Besides trying to make the content easy to follow, here summarizes the uniqueness of this book: (1) it offers Python source code that is tailored to be simple so that it would be natural for you to use in interviews (2) all the exercises and examples are from Leetcode problems so that you get to practise online (3) Classical algorithms are explained with design principles. No algorithm is magic. (Check out [advanced graph algorithms](https://github.com/liyin2015/Hands-on-Algorithmic-Problem-Solving/blob/master/chapters_pdf/chapter_advanced_graph_algorithm.pdf) as an example) (4) problem patterns to help you tackle coding interview questions topic by topic.
## How did I come up with this book?
Preparing for the coding interview is not easy! Cracking the coding interview? Nearly impossible for most of us! Luck does play a role in the outcome. So, let's just treat it as a learning process and have some fun!

Computer Science is really not just computer science. It is a combination of all fields; our normal interview problems fall into the enumerative combinatorics and our computer vision mostly consists of Linear Algebra. What really matters is our passion to learn and the ability to apply this knowledge to solve real-life problems. 

There are plenty of books out there focusing on either teaching algorithmic knowledge  (*Introduction to Algorithms*, *Algorithmic Problem Solving*, etc) or introducing the interview process and solving interview problems(*Cracking the Coding Interview*, *Coding Interview Questions*, etc), but none of these books truly combine the two. This is a book designed to make up this role in the categorization. Principle, Pattern, and Leetcode Problems make up the core of this book.

<!---We guide the reader to master data structures, algorithm design and analysis, and problem-patterns through playing around with toy examples coded in Python thoroughly. Analyzing the behavior and computational complexity of more restricted and clearly-defined problems in the book helps lay the foundation of solving real-world problems which are more open and challenging. -->

This is **NOT** a book that provides hiring statistics for each company or gives the reader quick tricks in order to pass a few coding interviews.  Its purpose is to show you the beauty of algorithmic problem solving in the hope that you will be more passionate and confident about software engineering; the interview questions just set up a playground where we strengthen what we learn. 

<!---A strong candidate would be able to sleep well before interviews, walk into the interviews and discuss his or her findings about the question from all possible angles and program the best solution for on the white-board. The interviews should be a setting where the interviewers and interviewees both have a nice and happy talk; learning from each other instead of a one-way relation -- tester and testee.--->
