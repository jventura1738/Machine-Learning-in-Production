The OTTO is an open source digital hardware synth, groovebox and FX processor. For information and documentation see [our website](https://bitfieldaudio.com)!

We would like to invite you to our **[discord server](https://discord.gg/4cV9Ucz)** where we hang out and discuss all things OTTO.

# Support the project

As hardware test boards costs money, and many of you have asked how you can contribute in a financial way, we have decided to set up a Patreon account. With Patreon, you can send us a small monthly amount of money, or make a one-time donation by cancelling the monthly subscription after the first payment (Note that this usually happens on the first of the month, not immediately.)
