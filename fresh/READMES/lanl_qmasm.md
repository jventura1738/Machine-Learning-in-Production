QMASM: A Quantum Macro Assembler
================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lanl/qmasm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lanl/qmasm)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/qmasm.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/qmasm)

Description
-----------

QMASM fills a gap in the software ecosystem for [D-Wave's adiabatic quantum computers](http://www.dwavesys.com/) by shielding the programmer from having to know system-specific hardware details while still enabling programs to be expressed at a fairly low level of abstraction.  It is therefore analogous to a conventional macro assembler and can be used in much the same way: as a target either for programmers who want a great deal of control over the hardware or for compilers that implement higher-level languages.

N.B. This tool used to be called "QASM" but was renamed to avoid confusion with [MIT's QASM](http://www.media.mit.edu/quanta/quanta-web/projects/qasm-tools/), which is used to describe quantum circuits (a different model of quantum computation from what the D-Wave uses) and the [IBM Quantum Experience](http://www.research.ibm.com/quantum/)'s [QASM (now OpenQASM) language](https://github.com/QISKit/openqasm), also used for describing quantum circuits.

Installation
------------

QMASM is written in Python.  The latest release can be downloaded and installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qmasm/) via
```bash
pip install qmasm
```

Alternatively, QMASM can be installed manually from GitHub using the standard [Setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/) installation mechanisms.  For example, use
```bash
python setup.py install
```
to install QMASM in the default location and
```bash
python setup.py install --prefix=/my/install/directory
```
to install elsewhere.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for QMASM can be found on the [QMASM wiki](https://github.com/lanl/qmasm/wiki).

QMASM (then known as QASM) is discussed in the following publication:
