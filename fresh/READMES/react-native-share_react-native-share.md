# Getting started

---

If you are using `react-native >= 0.60` you just need to do a simple:

```shell
yarn add react-native-share
```

Or if are using npm:

```shell
npm i react-native-share --save
```

After that, we need to install the dependencies to use the project on iOS(you can skip this part, if you are using this on Android).

Now run a simple: `npx pod-install` or `cd ios && pod install`. After that, you should be able to use the library on both Platforms, iOS and Android.

Then simply import:

```js
import Share from 'react-native-share';

Share.open(options)
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    err && console.log(err);
  });
```

Which you do something similar to this:
