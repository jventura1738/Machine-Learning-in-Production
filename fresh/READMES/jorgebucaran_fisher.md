## Quickstart

You can install, update, and remove plugins interactively with Fisher, taking advantage of Fish [tab completion](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#completion) and rich syntax highlighting.

### Installing plugins

Install plugins using the `install` command followed by the path to the repository on GitHub.

```console
fisher install ilancosman/tide
```

To get a specific version of a plugin add an `@` symbol after the plugin name followed by a tag, branch, or [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefcommit-ishacommit-ishalsocommittish).

```console
fisher install jorgebucaran/nvm.fish@2.1.0
```

You can install plugins from a local directory too.

```console
fisher install ~/path/to/plugin
```

> Fisher expands plugins into your Fish configuration directory by default, overwriting existing files. If you wish to change this behavior, set `$fisher_path` to your preferred location and put it in your function path ([#640](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/issues/640)).

### Listing plugins

List all the plugins that are currently installed using the `list` command.

```console
$ fisher list
jorgebucaran/fisher
ilancosman/tide
jorgebucaran/nvm.fish@2.1.0
/home/jb/path/to/plugin
```

The `list` command also accepts a regular expression to filter the output.

```console
$ fisher list \^/
/home/jb/path/to/plugin
```

### Updating plugins

The `update` command updates one or more plugins to their latest version.

```console
fisher update jorgebucaran/fisher
```

> Use just `fisher update` to update everything.

### Removing plugins

Remove installed plugins using the `remove` command.

```console
fisher remove jorgebucaran/nvm.fish@2.1.0
```

You may want to remove everything, including Fisher.

```console
fisher list | fisher remove
```

## Using your `fish_plugins` file

Whenever you install or remove a plugin from the command line, Fisher will write down all the installed plugins plugins to `$__fish_config_dir/fish_plugins`. Adding this file to your dotfiles or version control is the easiest way to share your configuration across different systems.

You can also edit this file and run `fisher update` to commit changes. Here's an example diff that represents such an edit:

```console
nano $__fish_config_dir/fish_plugins
```

```diff
jorgebucaran/fisher
ilancosman/tide
jorgebucaran/nvm.fish@2.1.0
+ PatrickF1/fzf.fish
- /home/jb/path/to/plugin
```

```console
fisher update
```

That will install **PatrickF1**/**fzf.fish**, remove /**home**/**jb**/**path**/**to**/**plugin**, and update everything else.

## Creating a plugin

A plugin can be any number of files in a `functions`, `conf.d`, and `completions` directory. Most plugins consist of a single function, or [configuration snippet](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/#initialization-files). This is what a typical plugin looks like.

<pre>
<b>ponyo</b>
├── <b>completions</b>
│   └── ponyo.fish
├── <b>conf.d</b>
│   └── ponyo.fish
└── <b>functions</b>
    └── ponyo.fish
</pre>

Non `.fish` files as well as directories inside those locations will be copied to `$fisher_path` under `functions`, `conf.d`, or `completions` respectively.

### Event system

Plugins are notified as they are being installed, updated, or removed via Fish [events](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/emit.html).

> `--on-event` functions must already be loaded when their event is emitted. Thus, you should put your event handlers in the `conf.d` directory.

```fish
# Defined in ponyo/conf.d/ponyo.fish

function _ponyo_install --on-event ponyo_install
    # Set universal variables, create bindings, and other initialization logic.
end

function _ponyo_update --on-event ponyo_update
    # Migrate resources, print warnings, and other update logic.
end

function _ponyo_uninstall --on-event ponyo_uninstall
    # Erase "private" functions, variables, bindings, and other uninstall logic.
end
```
