## Auto-embed Videos
For some video streaming websites such as Youtube, Vimeo, Twitch, Daily Motion etc, Pennywise shows you the video only web page by default (using the auto-generated embed links), showing you the video in a distract free manner. You can disable that by toggling the `Edit > Embed Videos`.

> **Note** – In case of youtube, [it might not work sometime](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/pennywise/issues/62) when the user has put restrictions on the video – in that case, you will have to disable "Auto Embed" option from the Edit menu to make them work. 

#### Why is it named Pennywise?

Because the application helps in floating and [Pennywise loved to do that](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzjWMLv_ZJI&t=3m15s)
