## Contributing

Contributions to JUnit 5 are both welcomed and appreciated. For specific guidelines
regarding contributions, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md] in the root directory of the
project. Those willing to use milestone or SNAPSHOT releases are encouraged
to file feature requests and bug reports using the project's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues). Issues marked with an
<a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aup-for-grabs">`up-for-grabs`</a>
label are specifically targeted for community contributions.

## Getting Help

Ask JUnit 5 related questions on [StackOverflow] or chat with the team and the community on [Gitter].

## Continuous Integration Builds

[![CI Status](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/actions) [![Cross-Version Status](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/workflows/Cross-Version/badge.svg)](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/actions)

Official CI build server for JUnit 5. Used to perform quick checks on submitted pull
requests and for build matrices including the latest released OpenJDK and early access
builds of the next OpenJDK.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage using [JaCoCo] for the latest build is available on [Codecov].

A code coverage report can also be generated locally via the [Gradle Wrapper] by
executing `gradlew -PenableJaCoCo clean jacocoRootReport`. The results will be available
in `build/reports/jacoco/jacocoRootReport/html/index.html`.

## Gradle Build Scans and Build Caching

[![Revved up by Gradle Enterprise](https://img.shields.io/badge/Revved%20up%20by-Gradle%20Enterprise-06A0CE?logo=Gradle&labelColor=02303A)](https://ge.junit.org/scans)

JUnit 5 utilizes [Gradle Enterprise](https://gradle.com/) for _Build Scans_ and the
_Remote Build Cache_. An example build scan for JUnit 5 can be viewed
[here](https://ge.junit.org/s/2vwrn4rn67dky). Currently, only core team members can
publish build scans. The remote build cache, however, is enabled by default for everyone
so that local builds can reuse task outputs from previous CI builds.

## Building from Source

You need [JDK 11] to build JUnit 5. [Gradle toolchains] are used to detect and
potentially download additional JDKs for compilation and test execution.

All modules can be _built_ with the [Gradle Wrapper] using the following command.

`gradlew clean assemble`

All modules can be _tested_ with the [Gradle Wrapper] using the following command.

`gradlew clean test`

Since Gradle has excellent incremental build support, you can usually omit executing the
`clean` task.

## Installing in Local Maven Repository

All modules can be _installed_ with the [Gradle Wrapper] in a local Maven repository for
consumption in other projects via the following command.

`gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal`

## Dependency Metadata

Consult the [Dependency Metadata] section of the [User Guide] for a list of all artifacts
of the JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter, and JUnit Vintage.
