Livebook is a web application for writing interactive and collaborative code notebooks built with [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view). It features:

  * Code notebooks with Markdown support and Elixir cells where code is evaluated on demand.

  * Persistence: notebooks can be persisted to disk through the `.livemd` format, which is a subset of Markdown. This means your notebooks can be saved for later, easily shared, and they also play well with version control.

  * Sequential evaluation: code cells run in a specific order, guaranteeing future users of the same Livebook see the same output. If you re-execute a previous cell, following cells are marked as stale to make it clear they depend on outdated notebook state.

  * Support for mathematical formulas via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and graphs via [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/).

  * Display and control rich and interactive widgets via [Kino](https://github.com/elixir-nx/kino): you can manipulate charts, tables, and more.

  * Explicit dependencies: if your notebook has dependencies, they are explicitly listed and installed with the help of the `Mix.install/2` command in Elixir v1.12+.

  * Custom runtimes: when executing Elixir code, you can either start a fresh Elixir instance, connect to an existing node, or run it inside an existing Elixir project, with access to all of its modules and dependencies. This means Livebook can be a great tool to provide live documentation for existing projects.

  * Collaborative features allow multiple users to work on the same notebook at once. Collaboration works either in single-node or multi-node deployments - without a need for additional tooling.

We are actively working on Livebook and you can consult the issues tracker to see some of the features we are exploring. We also want to thank [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) for inspiring some of our features.

## Getting started

Livebook comes with a series of introductory notebooks to get you up and running. Just head down to the "Usage" section below to install it. Here is a peek at the "Welcome to Livebook" introductory notebook:

From time to time, we also publish some videos for new Livebook releases:

  * [Livebook's initial announcement by José Valim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKvqc-UEe34), also featuring [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx) and [Axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon)

  * [New in Livebook v0.2 by José Valim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOTEgF-wIEI), exploring inputs, charts of mathemtical formulas, and live display of runtime metrics

## Usage

We provide several distinct methods of running Livebook,
pick the one that best fits your use case.

You will need [Elixir v1.12](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) or later.
Livebook also requires the following Erlang applications: `inets`,
`os_mon`, `runtime_tools`, and `ssl`. Those applications come with
most Erlang distributions but certain package managers may split
them apart. For example, on Ubuntu, these Erlang applications could
be installed as follows:

```shell
sudo apt install erlang-inets erlang-os-mon erlang-runtime-tools erlang-ssl
```

### Escript

Running Livebook using Escript makes for a very convenient option
for local usage and provides easy configuration via CLI options.

```shell
mix escript.install hex livebook

# Start the Livebook server
livebook server

# See all the configuration options
livebook server --help
```

After you install the escript, make sure you add the directory where
Elixir keeps escripts to your [$PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).
If you installed Elixir with `asdf`, you'll need to run `asdf reshim elixir`
once the escript is built.

To try out features from the main branch you can alternatively
install the escript directly from GitHub like this:

```shell
mix escript.install github elixir-nx/livebook
```

### Docker

Running Livebook using Docker is a great option for cloud deployments
and also for local usage in case you don't have Elixir installed.

```shell
# Running with the default configuration
docker run -p 8080:8080 --pull always livebook/livebook

# In order to access and save notebooks directly to your machine
# you can mount a local directory into the container.
# Make sure to specify the user with "-u $(id -u):$(id -g)"
# so that the created files have proper permissions
docker run -p 8080:8080 --pull always -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v <LOCAL_DIR>:/data livebook/livebook

# You can configure Livebook using environment variables,
# for all options see the dedicated "Environment variables" section below
docker run -p 8080:8080 --pull always -e LIVEBOOK_PASSWORD="securesecret" livebook/livebook
```

To try out features from the main branch you can alternatively
use the `livebook/livebook:edge` image.
See [Livebook on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/livebook/livebook/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).

### Mix

You can run latest Livebook directly with Mix.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/elixir-nx/livebook.git
cd livebook
mix deps.get --only prod

# Run the Livebook server
MIX_ENV=prod mix phx.server
```

### Security considerations

Livebook is built to document and execute code. Anyone with access to a Livebook instance will be able to access any file and execute any code in the machine Livebook is running.

For this reason, Livebook only binds to the 127.0.0.1, allowing access to happen only within the current machine. When running Livebook in the production environment - the recommended environment - we also generate a token on initialization and we only allow access to the Livebook if said token is supplied as part of the URL.

### Environment variables
<!-- Environment variables -->

The following environment variables configure Livebook:

  * LIVEBOOK_COOKIE - sets the cookie for running Livebook in a cluster.
    Defaults to a random string that is generated on boot.

  * LIVEBOOK_DEFAULT_RUNTIME - sets the runtime type that is used by default
    when none is started explicitly for the given notebook. Must be either
    "standalone" (Elixir standalone), "mix[:PATH]" (Mix standalone),
    "attached:NODE:COOKIE" (Attached node) or "embedded" (Embedded).
    Defaults to "standalone".

  * LIVEBOOK_IP - sets the ip address to start the web application on.
    Must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.

  * LIVEBOOK_PASSWORD - sets a password that must be used to access Livebook.
    Must be at least 12 characters. Defaults to token authentication.

  * LIVEBOOK_PORT - sets the port Livebook runs on. If you want multiple instances
    to run on the same domain but different ports, you also need to set 'LIVEBOOK_SECRET_KEY_BASE'.
    Defaults to 8080.

  * LIVEBOOK_ROOT_PATH - sets the root path to use for file selection.

  * LIVEBOOK_SECRET_KEY_BASE - sets a secret key that is used to sign and encrypt
    the session and other payloads used by Livebook. Must be at least 64 characters
    long and it can be generated by commands such as: 'openssl rand -base64 48'.
    Defaults to a random secret on every boot.

<!-- Environment variables -->

## Development

Livebook is primarily a Phoenix web application and can be setup as such:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/elixir-nx/livebook.git
cd livebook
mix deps.get

# Run the Livebook server
mix phx.server

# To test escript
MIX_ENV=prod mix escript.build
./livebook server
```
