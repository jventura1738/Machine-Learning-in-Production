**Scrollama** is a modern & lightweight JavaScript library for scrollytelling
using
[IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
in favor of scroll events.

**Current version**: 2.2.1

#### Important Changes

- **Version 2.0.0+**: `.onContainerEnter` and `.onContainerExit` have been deprecated in favor of CSS property `position: sticky;`. [How to use position sticky.](https://pudding.cool/process/scrollytelling-sticky/)
- **Version 1.4.0+**: you must manually add the IntersectionObserver polyfill for cross-browser support. See [installation](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama#installation) for details.

### Why?

Scrollytelling can be complicated to implement and difficult to make performant.
The goal of this library is to provide a simple interface for creating
scroll-driven interactives. Scrollama is focused on performance by using
[IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
to handle element position detection.

### Examples

_Note: most of these examples use D3 to keep the code concise, but this can be used
with any library, or with no library at all._

- [Basic](https://russellgoldenberg.github.io/scrollama/basic) - just step
  triggers
- [Progress](https://russellgoldenberg.github.io/scrollama/progress) -
  incremental step progress callback
- [Sticky Graphic (Side by Side)](https://russellgoldenberg.github.io/scrollama/sticky-side) -
  using CSS `position: sticky;` to create a fixed graphic to the side of the text.
- [Sticky Graphic (Overlay)](https://russellgoldenberg.github.io/scrollama/sticky-overlay) -
  using CSS `position: sticky;` to create a fixed graphic with fullscreen graphic with text overlayed.
- [Mobile Pattern](https://russellgoldenberg.github.io/scrollama/mobile-pattern) -
  using pixels instead of percent for offset value so it doesn't jump around on scroll direction change

### Installation

**Note: As of version 1.4.0, the IntersectionObserver polyfill has been removed from the build. You must include it yourself for cross-browser support.** Check [here](https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver) to see if you need to include the polyfill.

Old school (exposes the `scrollama` global):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/intersection-observer"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/scrollama"></script>
```

New school:

```sh
npm install scrollama intersection-observer --save
```

And then import/require it:

```js
import "intersection-observer";
import scrollama from "scrollama"; // or...
const scrollama = require("scrollama");
```

### How to use

#### Basic

You can use this library to simply trigger steps, similar to something like
[Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/). This is useful if you need
more control over your interactive, or you don't want to follow the sticky
scrollytelling pattern.

You can use any id/class naming conventions you want. The HTML structure should
look like:

```html
<!--you don't need the "data-step" attr, but can be useful for storing instructions for JS -->
<div class="step" data-step="a"></div>
<div class="step" data-step="b"></div>
<div class="step" data-step="c"></div>
```

```js
// instantiate the scrollama
const scroller = scrollama();

// setup the instance, pass callback functions
scroller
  .setup({
    step: ".step",
  })
  .onStepEnter((response) => {
    // { element, index, direction }
  })
  .onStepExit((response) => {
    // { element, index, direction }
  });

// setup resize event
window.addEventListener("resize", scroller.resize);
```

### API

#### scrollama.setup([options])

_options:_

- `step` (string | HTMLElement[]): Selector (or array of elements) for the step elements that will trigger changes.
  **required**
- `offset` (number 0 - 1, or string with "px"): How far from the top of the viewport to trigger a step. **(default: 0.5) (middle of screen)**
- `progress` (boolean): Whether to fire incremental step progress updates or
  not. **(default: false)**
- `threshold` (number, 1+): The granularity of the progress interval in pixels (smaller = more granular). **(default: 4)**
- `order` (boolean): Fire previous step triggers if they were jumped. **(default: true)**
- `once` (boolean): Only trigger the step to enter once then remove listener. **(default: false)**
- `debug` (boolean): Whether to show visual debugging tools or not. **(default:
  false)**
- `parent` (HTMLElement[]): Parent element for step selector (use if you steps are in shadow DOM) **(default: undefined)**

#### scrollama.onStepEnter(callback)

Callback that fires when the top or bottom edge of a step element enters the
offset threshold.

The argument of the callback is an object: `{ element: DOMElement, index: number, direction: string }`

`element`: The step element that triggered

`index`: The index of the step of all steps

`direction`: 'up' or 'down'

#### scrollama.onStepExit(callback)

Callback that fires when the top or bottom edge of a step element exits the
offset threshold.

The argument of the callback is an object: `{ element: DOMElement, index: number, direction: string }`

`element`: The step element that triggered

`index`: The index of the step of all steps

`direction`: 'up' or 'down'

#### scrollama.onStepProgress(callback)

Callback that fires the progress (0 - 1) a step has made through the threshold.

The argument of the callback is an object: `{ element: DOMElement, index: number, progress: number }`

`element`: The step element that triggered

`index`: The index of the step of all steps

`progress`: The percent of completion of the step (0 - 1)

#### scrollama.offsetTrigger([number or string])

Get or set the offset percentage. Value must be between 0-1 (where 0 = top of viewport, 1 = bottom), or a string that includes "px" (e.g., "200px"). If set, returns the scrollama instance.

#### scrollama.resize()

Tell scrollama to get latest dimensions the browser/DOM. It is best practice to
throttle resize in your code, update the DOM elements, then call this function
at the end.

#### scrollama.enable()

Tell scrollama to resume observing for trigger changes. Only necessary to call
if you have previously disabled.

#### scrollama.disable()

Tell scrollama to stop observing for trigger changes.

#### scrollama.destroy()

Removes all observers and callback functions.

### Tips

- Always call `scrollama.resize()` after a window resize event to ensure scroll
  triggers update with new dimensions.
- Avoid using `viewport height` (vh) in your CSS because scrolling up and down
  constantly triggers vh to change, which will also trigger a window resize.

### Known Issues

The `.onStepProgress` function does not perform desirably in Safari, returning infrequent updates.
