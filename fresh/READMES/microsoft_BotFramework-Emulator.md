# Bot Framework Emulator

[![Build Status](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/BotFramework-Emulator/_apis/build/status/%5BV4-Nightly%5D-Main-Build?branchName=main)](https://fuselabs.visualstudio.com/BotFramework-Emulator/_build/latest?definitionId=419&branchName=main) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator?branch=main)

The Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug bots built using the [Bot Framework SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder). You can use the Bot Framework Emulator to test bots running either locally on your machine or connect to bots running remotely through a tunnel.

This repo is part the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk) - a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade conversational AI experiences.

## Download

* Download the Bot Framework V4 Emulator for your platform from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases/latest) page.

### Supported platforms

* Windows
* OS X
* Linux

  **Note for Linux users:**

  The Emulator leverages a library that uses `libsecret` so you may need to install it before running `npm install`.

  Depending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:

  Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`

  Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`

  Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`

## Nightly builds

Nightly builds are generated using the latest code. Therefore, they may not be stable, and most likely lack up to date documentation. These builds are better suited for more experienced users, although everyone is welcome to use them and provide feedback. Nightly builds of the V4 Emulator are available [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-emulator-nightlies/releases).
