# GitHub CLI

`gh` is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code.

GitHub CLI is available for repositories hosted on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+, and to install on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Comparison with hub

For many years, [hub][] was the unofficial GitHub CLI tool. `gh` is a new project that helps us explore
what an official GitHub CLI tool can look like with a fundamentally different design. While both
tools bring GitHub to the terminal, `hub` behaves as a proxy to `git`, and `gh` is a standalone
tool. Check out our [more detailed explanation][gh-vs-hub] to learn more.
