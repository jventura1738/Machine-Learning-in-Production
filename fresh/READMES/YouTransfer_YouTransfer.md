YouTransfer is a simple but elegant self-hosted file transfer & sharing solution. It is an alternative to paid services like [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) and [WeTransfer](http://wetransfer.com) by offering similar features but without limitations, price plans and a lengthy privacy policy. You remain in control of your files.

Created to be installed behind the firewall on private servers, YouTransfer aims to empower organisations and individuals that wish to combine easy-to-use file transfer tooling with security and control.

You can follow the project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/youtransfer), or [read our blog](http://blog.youtransfer.io). 

## Demo

A live demo of YouTransfer is available on http://demo.youtransfer.io  
The demo is [somewhat limited](https://github.com/youtransfer/YouTransfer/wiki/Demo) so it is recommended to run it locally (see quick start section below).

## Documentation

### Quick Start using Docker

If you wish to install YouTransfer in your own environment without any modifications, the [Docker image](http://hub.docker.com/r/remie/youtransfer/) is the most quick and easy approach. Simply [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and run:

`docker pull remie/youtransfer:stable`

You can run the application with the following command:

````
docker run -d \
-v [path_to_upload_folder]:/opt/youtransfer/uploads \
-v [path_to_config_folder]:/opt/youtransfer/config \
-p 80:5000 \
remie/youtransfer:stable
````

You can now connect to YouTransfer by browsing to http://[docker_host_ip]/
