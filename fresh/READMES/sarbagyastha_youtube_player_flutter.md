Flutter plugin for playing or streaming YouTube videos inline using the official [**iFrame Player API**](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference).
The package exposes almost all the API provided by **iFrame Player API**. So, it's 100% customizable.

Note: This package only provides default youtube web player's skin. If you need Youtube Android player like player with gesture support, use [youtube_player_flutter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/youtube_player_flutter) instead.
`youtube_player_flutter` also uses this package as dependency. (Migration Pending)

Supported Platforms:
- **Android** 
- **iOS**
- **Web**

## Salient Features
* Inline Playback
* Supports captions
* No need for API Key
* Supports custom controls
* Retrieves video meta data
* Supports Live Stream videos
* Supports changing playback rate
* Support for both Android and iOS
* Adapts to quality as per the bandwidth
* Exposes builders for building custom controls
* Playlist Support (Both custom and Youtube's playlist)


For Web, Flutter's [HtmlElementView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/HtmlElementView-class.html).
For Android & iOS, the package uses [flutter_inappwebview](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_inappwebview) under-the-hood.

Since *flutter_inappwebview* relies on Flutter's mechanism for embedding Android and iOS views, this plugin might share some known issues tagged with the [platform-views](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/labels/a%3A%20platform-views) label.

## Requirements
* **Android**: `minSdkVersion 17` and add support for `androidx` (see [AndroidX Migration](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/androidx-migration))
* **iOS**: `--ios-language swift`, Xcode version `>= 11`
* **Web**: None

## Setup

### Web
No Configuration Required.

### iOS
No Configuration Required.

[Follow the guide here for complete iOS setup](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview#important-note-for-ios)

### Android
Set `minSdkVersion` of your `android/app/build.gradle` file to at least 17.

[Follow the guide here for complete Android setup](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview#important-note-for-android)

*Note:* Although the minimum to be set is 17, the player won't play on device with API < 20 (19 if Hybrid Composition is enabled). 
For API < 20 devices, you might want to forward the video to be played using YouTube app instead, using packages like `url_launcher` or `android_intent`.

#### Using the player

```dart
YoutubePlayerController _controller = YoutubePlayerController(
    initialVideoId: 'K18cpp_-gP8',
    params: YoutubePlayerParams(
        playlist: ['nPt8bK2gbaU', 'gQDByCdjUXw'], // Defining custom playlist
        startAt: Duration(seconds: 30),
        showControls: true,
        showFullscreenButton: true,
    ),
);

YoutubePlayerIFrame(
    controller: _controller,
    aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
),

-------------- OR --------------

YoutubePlayerControllerProvider( // Provides controller to all the widget below it.
  controller: _controller,
  child: YoutubePlayerIFrame(
    aspectRatio: 16 / 9,
  ),
);

// Access the controller as: `YoutubePlayerControllerProvider.of(context)` or `controller.ytController`.
```

## Want to customize the player?
The package provides `YoutubeValueBuilder`, which can be used to create any custom controls.

For example, let's create a custom play pause button.
```dart
YoutubeValueBuilder(
   controller: _controller, // This can be omitted, if using `YoutubePlayerControllerProvider`
   builder: (context, value) {
      return IconButton(
         icon: Icon( 
                  value.playerState == PlayerState.playing
                    ? Icons.pause
                    : Icons.play_arrow,
         ),
         onPressed: value.isReady
            ? () {
                  value.playerState == PlayerState.playing
                    ? context.ytController.pause()
                    : context.ytController.play();
                 }
            : null,
      );
   },
);
```
