# Yomichan

Yomichan turns your web browser into a tool for building Japanese language literacy by helping you to decipher texts
which would be otherwise too difficult tackle. This extension is similar to
[Rikaichamp](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichamp/) for Firefox and
[Rikaikun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rikaikun/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp?hl=en) for Chrome, but it
stands apart in its goal of being an all-encompassing learning tool as opposed to a mere browser-based dictionary.

Yomichan provides advanced features not available in other browser-based dictionaries:

*   Interactive popup definition window for displaying search results.
*   On-demand audio playback for select dictionary definitions.
*   Kanji stroke order diagrams are just a click away for most characters.
*   Custom search page for easily executing custom search queries.
*   Support for multiple dictionary formats including [EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING) via the [Yomichan Import](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan-import) tool.
*   Automatic note creation for the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcard program via the [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) plugin.
*   Clean, modern code makes it easy for developers to [contribute](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) new features.

## Installation

Yomichan comes in two flavors: *stable* and *testing*. Over the years, this extension has evolved to contain many
complex features which have become increasingly difficult to test across different browsers, versions, and
environments. New changes are initially introduced into the *testing* version, and after some time spent ensuring
that they are relatively bug free, they will be promoted to the *stable* version. If you are technically savvy and don't mind
submitting issues on GitHub, try the *testing* version; otherwise, the *stable* version will be your best bet.

*   **Google Chrome**
    ([stable](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami) or [testing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan-testing/bcknnfebhefllbjhagijobjklocakpdm))

## Dictionaries

There are several free Japanese dictionaries available for Yomichan, with two of them having glossaries available in
different languages. You must download and import the dictionaries you wish to use in order to enable Yomichan
definition lookups. If you have proprietary EPWING dictionaries that you would like to use, check the [Yomichan
Import](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan-import) page to learn how to convert and import them into Yomichan.

Be aware that the non-English dictionaries contain fewer entries than their English counterparts. Even if your
primary language is not English, you may consider also importing the English version for better coverage.

    <a href="resources/images/browser-action-popup1.png"><img src="resources/images/browser-action-popup1.png" width="103" height="100"></a>

    *   The <img src="ext/images/cog.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _cog_ button will open the Settings page.
    *   The <img src="ext/images/magnifying-glass.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _magnifying glass_ button will open the Search page.
    *   The <img src="ext/images/question-mark-circle.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _question mark_ button will open the Information page.
    *   The <img src="ext/images/profile.svg" alt="" width="16" height="16"> _profile_ button will appear when multiple profiles exist, allowing the current profile to be quickly changed.

2.  Import the dictionaries you wish to use for term and kanji searches. If you do not have any dictionaries installed
    or enabled, Yomichan will warn you that it is not ready for use by displaying an orange exclamation mark over its
    icon. This exclamation mark will disappear once you have installed and enabled at least one dictionary.

## Custom Dictionaries

Yomichan supports the use of custom dictionaries, including the esoteric but popular
[EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING) format. They were often utilized in portable electronic dictionaries
similar to the ones pictured below. These dictionaries are often sought after by language learners for their correctness
and excellent coverage of the Japanese language.

Unfortunately, as most of the dictionaries released in this format are proprietary, they are unable to be bundled with
Yomichan. Instead, you will need to procure these dictionaries yourself and import them using [Yomichan
Import](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan-import). Check the project page for additional details.

## Anki Integration

Yomichan features automatic flashcard creation for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a free application designed to help you
retain knowledge. This feature requires the prior installation of an Anki plugin called [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect).
Check the respective project page for more information about how to set up this software.

### Flashcard Configuration

Before flashcards can be automatically created, you must configure the templates used to create term and/or kanji notes.
If you are unfamiliar with Anki deck and model management, this would be a good time to reference the [Anki
Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/). In short, you must specify what information should be included in the
flashcards that Yomichan creates through AnkiConnect.

Flashcard fields can be configured with the following steps:

1.  Open the Yomichan options page and scroll down to the section labeled *Anki Options*.
2.  Tick the checkbox labeled *Enable Anki integration* (Anki must be running with [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) installed).
3.  Select the type of template to configure by clicking on either the *Terms* or *Kanji* tabs.
4.  Select the Anki deck and model to use for new creating new flashcards of this type.
5.  Fill the model fields with markers corresponding to the information you wish to include (several can be used at
    once). Advanced users can also configure the actual [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates used to create
    the flashcard contents (this is strictly optional).

When creating your model for Yomichan, *make sure that you pick a unique field to be first*; fields that will
contain `{expression}` or `{character}` are ideal candidates for this. Anki does not allow duplicate flashcards to be
added to a deck by default; it uses the first field in the model to check for duplicates. For example, if you have `{reading}`
configured to be the first field in your model and <ruby>橋<rt>はし</rt></ruby> is already in your deck, you will not
be able to create a flashcard for <ruby>箸<rt>はし</rt></ruby> because they share the same reading.

### Flashcard Creation

Once Yomichan is configured, it becomes trivial to create new flashcards with a single click. You will see the following
icons next to term definitions:

*   Clicking ![](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/img/btn-add-expression.png) adds the current expression as kanji (e.g. 食べる).
*   Clicking ![](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/img/btn-add-reading.png) adds the current expression as hiragana or katakana (e.g. たべる).

Below are some troubleshooting tips you can try if you are unable to create new flashcards:

*   Individual icons will appear grayed out if a flashcard cannot be created for the current definition (e.g. it already exists in the deck).
*   If all of the buttons appear grayed out, then you should double-check your deck and model configuration settings.
*   If no icons appear at all, make sure that Anki is running in the background and that [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect) has been installed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I'm having problems importing dictionaries in Firefox, what do I do?**

Yomichan uses the cross-browser IndexedDB system for storing imported dictionary data into your user profile. Although
everything "just works" in Chrome, depending on settings, Firefox users can run into problems due to browser bugs.
Yomichan catches errors and tries to offer suggestions about how to work around Firefox issues, but in general at least
one of the following solutions should work for you:

*   Make sure you have cookies enabled. It appears that disabling them also disables IndexedDB for some reason. You
    can still have cookies be disabled on other sites; just make sure to add the Yomichan extension to the whitelist of
    whatever tool you are using to restrict cookies. You can get the extension "URL" by looking at the address bar when
    you have the search page open.
*   Make sure that you have sufficient disk space available on the drive Firefox uses to store your user profile.
    Firefox limits the amount of space that can be used by IndexedDB to a small fraction of the disk space actually
    available on your computer.
*   Make sure that you have history set to "Remember history" enabled in your privacy settings. When this option is
    set to "Never remember history", IndexedDB access is once again disabled for an inexplicable reason.
*   As a last resort, try using the [Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-preferences-fix-problems)
    feature to reset your user profile. It appears that the Firefox profile system can corrupt itself preventing
    IndexedDB from being accessible to Yomichan.

**Why does the kanji results page display "No data found" for several fields?**

You are using data from the KANJIDIC dictionary that was exported for an earlier version of Yomichan. It does not
contain the additional information which newer versions of Yomichan expect. Unfortunately, since major browser
implementations of IndexedDB do not provide reliable means for selective bulk data deletion, you will need to purge
your database and install the latest version of the KANJIDIC to see additional information about characters.

**Can I still create cards without HTML formatting? The option for it is gone!**

Developing Yomichan is a constant balance between including useful features and keeping complexity at a minimum.
With the new user-editable card template system, it is possible to create text-only cards without having to double
the number of field templates in the extension itself. If you would like to stop HTML tags from being added to your
cards, simply copy the contents of the [text-only field template](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/dl/fields.txt)
into the template box on the Anki settings page (make sure you have the *Show advanced options* checkbox ticked),
making sure to replace the existing values.

**Will you add support for online dictionaries?**

Online dictionaries will not be implemented because it is not possible to support them in a robust way. In order to
perform Japanese deinflection, Yomichan must execute dozens of database queries for every single word. Factoring in
network latency and the fragility of web scraping, it would not be possible to maintain a good and consistent user
experience.

**Is it possible to use Yomichan with files saved locally on my computer with Chrome?**

In order to use Yomichan with local files in Chrome, you must first tick the *Allow access to file URLs* checkbox
for Yomichan on the extensions page. Due to the restrictions placed on browser addons in the WebExtensions model, it
will likely never be possible to use Yomichan with PDF files.

**Is it possible to delete individual dictionaries without purging the database?**

Yomichan is able to delete individual dictionaries, but keep in mind that this process can be *very* slow and can
cause the browser to become unresponsive. The time it takes to delete a single dictionary can sometimes be roughly
the same as the time it originally took to import, which can be significant for certain large dictionaries.

**Why aren't EPWING dictionaries bundled with Yomichan?**

The vast majority of EPWING dictionaries are proprietary, so they are unfortunately not able to be included in
this extension due to copyright reasons.

**When are you going to add support for $MYLANGUAGE?**

Developing Yomichan requires a decent understanding of Japanese sentence structure and grammar, and other languages
are likely to have their own unique set of rules for syntax, grammar, inflection, and so on. Supporting additional
languages would not only require many additional changes to the codebase, it would also incur significant maintenance
overhead and knowledge demands for the developers. Therefore, suggestions and contributions for supporting
new languages will be declined, allowing Yomichan's focus to remain Japanese-centric.
