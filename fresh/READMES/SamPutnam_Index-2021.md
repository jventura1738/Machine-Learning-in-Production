| [Why I'm NOT Investing In Dogecoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtuk7LsFN2E&t=57s) | I'm not going to invest in doge because unless i were trading it and i haven't checked because like i said i'm not in to the crypto scene but with bitcoin it trades 24 7 right so uh i imagine it's the same with doge i don't want to be trading a cryptocurrency that trades 24 7. first of all i wanted to stop being tradable at eight you know maybe open up in the morning like the normal market just to unplug you know maybe i am missing out on doge and bitcoin maybe i should be trading these um maybe but really honestly the right time to be have been trading bitcoin probably would have been like five years ago you know just about when the right time to start up a cryptocurrency exchange or be a market maker would have been probably five years ago at this point | Discord | May 2020 | alive | a month |
| [A Fervent Defense of Front-running HFTs](https://www.trade2win.com/threads/oh-dear-its-that-time-of-year-again.49234/) | The IB will take the 10M, charge the client 5k brokerage .Then they will use the 10M to short Apple then buy it back at 495 and keep another 100k and tell client he has his Apple at 500. The next day or week they will give the client a negative report on Apple convince him to sell it. They Sell at 497 and tell client the market moved fast and they got him out at at 492 and keep another 100k :D. They will keep doing variations of this until the client has no money. | Two Sigma | April 2020 | alive | a month |
| [Real-time batch prediction using Google AutoML and Feedforward Neural Networks for Penny Stock Trading Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvXVGgwiNBg&t=275s) | I tried creating a hundred thousand dollar trading bot in seven days. So hundred thousand dollar trading bot... is actually not that much. I was really trying to create one that would make me a million dollars, 10 million dollars, you know I would say 100 million dollars, but that wouldn't really be realistic that's more of like a uh type of algorithm that you would use if you worked for like Jane Street or one of these, um, you know proprietary trading firms. The most important use of AI in independent trading is not making a decision to trade or not trade a stock but to determine feature importance, because it will spit out a table of the importance of each feature in the overall decision of whether or not it was to tell you to trade it and whether or not it would be profitable or not, and it will rank those so you can just say wow okay so this energy sector is the most determining factor and whether or not a trade is going to be profitable even when I included the market capitalization, the float, and the exchange. Time to only watch energy stocks this week. | Jane Street | March 2020 | alive | a month |
| [Its not about companies, and its not about profits and not about management. Its about buyers and sellers. RIGHT NOW, are there more buyers, or are there more sellers. That's it. Its much more a game of psychology and thinking about "What is the market (read buyers and sellers) showing me, what does it want me to do, what should I be doing?" We were swing trading, very short term. Either we were riding the momentum, or we were waiting for stocks to get overextended in one direction, then bet against the trend.]() | Machine learning techniques can also recommend the best execution strategy. Based on prior trades and market data, machine learning algorithms can pick from, for instance, with-volume execution, order slicing, VWAP targeting or a mixture of these, even predicting the shape of the volume-over-time curve to minimize market impact. In addition, real-time AI-driven recommendation of individual order size, pace and price limit, and price trend data is also possible, with the trading algorithm becoming more aggressive in favorable market microconditions and less aggressive when the market is becoming unfavorable (or, indeed, vice versa, depending on the trader’s goals and views). | Citadel | February 2020 | alive | a month |
| [How I learned To Day Trade In A Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP_eW3qSi1M&t=11s) | You can scan around the whole market of stocks and just get those stocks that have a lot of sudden increase in volume or sudden increase or decrease in price and then just have a list of those a watch list of stocks that you can watch and those are the ones that are going up or going down or having more people getting into them really quickly so i just have my little watch list because i had this little scan set up and i was like oh i'm gonna have to pay for this scanning software right this could be a mistake say you have a thousand bucks and you want to day trade invest whatever you want to call it you want to get rich with the stock market and now you're buying the scans software for a hundred dollars fifty dollars a month and that's five hundred dollars a year you just lost half your investing budget no no no no no think or swim it's for td ameritrade it's called think or swim weird name think or swim isn't it supposed to be like sink or swim anyway so you can set up a little scan in there and look at only 3 stocks all day. just got to pick the right 3 stocks, via ai technology. no actually not ai lol just scan them like an if-then simple scan tree | Tiingo | January 2020 | alive | a month |
| [I TRIED TRADING STOCKS FOR A WEEK WITH $1,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leKUkbzADJ0&t=100s) | If you have a hundred dollars go get a job, I mean seriously hundred dollars what are you gonna buy a hundred shares of a penny stock and trade every day for five years and go up a percent a day have an incredible one percent a day return and have that hundred dollars turn into ten thousand dollars in five years. Oh man now you have to go work for a prop firm or get money from friends and family and trade their money and now you have people telling you what to do. Just start with more than 100, right. | Interactive Brokers | December 2020 | alive | a month |
| [Beginner Day Trading Mistakes I’ve Made! AVOID THESE!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaOYx-mO0NM&t=152s) | Here's a big one buying stocks that people tell you to buy on twitter on youtube and just expecting those stocks to be good stocks to buy because people told you that those are the stocks to buy i've tried that originally i was looking at people on twitter this was pretty sweet i followed all the good people on twitter i followed the um nate michaud uh zack morris uh pj matlock uh tim gratani um kyle williams matt monaco tim sykes uh jack daniel um mason fect and definitely bao nguyen um boy that's a good start uh cam the man is his last name uh jordan ariel um those people will tell you.... actually, none of them actually say this but one of them probably did i don't remember which one they'll give you little stocks that you can buy they're like check this one out on twitter this one's going up right now this one's going down right now mostly i looked at the going up because i didn't have shorting at the time yikes not easy to live your life this way like a robinhooder | Overextended gap down | November 2020 | dead | a month |
| [DAY TRADING REAL TRUTH…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4n4qTzdyks&t=74s) | Two percent in a day every day is insane that's extremely extremely good extremely good why do you even need two percent? Why not just get one percent a day people who get index funds get five percent a year maybe a little more maybe a little less stock market as a whole easy three percent guaranteed right over the long period of time, easy... more like eight to ten percent so why not just get one percent half a percent in a day. Can you beat the market by half a percent in day if you're glued to your screen for eight hours a day? Maybe, but why not just trade the morning 9 30 to 10 30. when all the stocks open up they do their thing with all the hedge funds and mutual fund guys getting their orders in so they can get their bonuses you don't care let them do their thing you do yours right after, remotely. Everyone's making money. | Short squeeze | October 2020 | alive | a month |
| [How Much Money Do I Need To Begin Investing - Penny Stocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsUQd7AQwHM&t=127s) | Margin means that it's not just a cash account, which is the money you put in, it's margin... an additional margin provided by the brokerage so that you can spend more money than you have in your account and use the margin as leverage this is important for short selling and this is why there's a two thousand dollar margin requirement for short selling in short selling if you short a stock and you short it because you think it's going to go down and it goes up it could go up more than the value of the stock. That's why you need to set a bracket order or at least a stop loss or at least have backup internet or live close to an internet hotspot, or have your broker's number on speed dial, you get the idea. It's rare. You'll be fine, probably. | Panic dip buy | September 2020 | dead | a month |
| [How to Invest in Stocks for Beginners 2021 - Step by Step Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A5ya8RtO0o&t=98s) | I just opened up an e-trade account yesterday, because I was like it's time you know it's time. I wanted to short some stocks as well, and they've got some ways to do that... to short them like instead of buying them like it's going to go up you short them because you're like... you're saying it's going to go down so it's the same thing as buying like an inverse stock okay don't judge me like an inverse like an opposite stock it's like buying a stock that it's the same thing, okay, it's cool. So okay you want to open an e-trade account maybe you want to open a td ameritrade account um that's a great one td ameritrade you're going to have thinkorswim trading it's like the apple of stocks okay think or swim... apple of stocks... those are what i recommend as a place to start, schwab no penny stock commissions. | Trading calendar with every trade taken on which day | August 2020 | dead | a month |
| [I Tried Creating A $100,000 Affiliate Marketing Business In 7 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZW3JdO-nfA&t=35s) | The ones that I think are good are like bankruptcy, divorce, like these super taboo businesses and people don't want to talk about them in person because otherwise if they did talk about in person they would just get a referral to someone who's local and you know the local lawyer uh would make the money and they wouldn't need you. | Integromat | July 2020 | dead | a month |
| [Lead generation campaigns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOuEfWiBqwY) | I'm not going to link to my actual sites, because I don't want you to copy my sites because it could make me make less money. Plus I don't want people filling out the forms as it will hurt my lead quality for my lead buyers, but in general if you see someone running an affiliate ad somewhere (for example, it's a lead generation ad where someone fills out their information or calls a number to get a quote, or it's a Shopify store) on Facebook or Google (there is also Outbrain/Taboola and many smaller ad networks, but Facebook/Instagram and Google/YouTube are most often used, followed by Outbrain/Taboola and I guess Snapchat) and they've been doing it consistently for a month, they are probably making more than they are spending. I do financial lead gen, becuase it is recession proof and it doesn't come and go like other trending markets; for example, diets like Keto. | I've tried auto finance, business finance, credit card, and credit repair. I've also added VoIP and credit monitoring questions to my forms, where I get paid on a CPA (cost per acquired customer) basis. I linked to a great video explaining what this industry is and why it is so profitable. | June 2020 | alive | a month |
| [Small business loan ad arbitrage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBsW0BgFZqQ&t=33s) | I stopped TikTok, because I needed to make money. It was a great marketing experiment though, not black magic at all, just pandering to a young audience. Although I lost some money on advertising my credit card site, I was able to make back $1800 last month by marketing small business loans using Facebook ads through an affiliate partnership. | I linked to a video where an acquaintance in the industry is talking about affiliate marketing. | May 2020 | alive | a month |
