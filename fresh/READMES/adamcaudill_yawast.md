**The YAWAST Antecedent Web Application Security Toolkit**

YAWAST is an application meant to simplify initial analysis and information gathering for penetration testers and security auditors. It performs basic checks in these categories:

* TLS/SSL - Versions and cipher suites supported; common issues.
* Information Disclosure - Checks for common information leaks.
* Presence of Files or Directories - Checks for files or directories that could indicate a security issue.
* Common Vulnerabilities
* Missing Security Headers

This is meant to provide a easy way to perform initial analysis and information discovery. It's not a full testing suite, and it certainly isn't Metasploit. The idea is to provide a quick way to perform initial data collection, which can then be used to better target further tests. It is especially useful when used in conjunction with Burp Suite (via the `--proxy` parameter).
