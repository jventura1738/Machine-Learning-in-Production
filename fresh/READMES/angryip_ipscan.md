The code is written mostly in Java (currently, source level 1.8).
IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for coding (Community Edition is fine): Import as Gradle project.

Projects supports building for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

## Building [![Actions Status](https://github.com/angryip/ipscan/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/angryip/ipscan/actions)

Use Gradle for building a package for your desired platform:

`./gradlew` or `make` in the project dir for the list of available targets.

`./gradlew current` would build the app for your current platform

The resulting binaries will be put into the `build/libs` directory.
Run jar files with `java -jar <jar-file>`.

Deb and rpm packages can only be built on Linux (tested on Ubuntu). 
Building of Windows installer can be done on Linux as well.

`./gradlew all` will build packages for all OS (tested on Ubuntu only, see dependencies below).

### Dependencies

On Ubuntu install the following packages:
```
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk rpm fakeroot wine-stable
```
Note: *wine* is needed for building of Windows installer.

Install OpenJDK on other platforms as you usually do it.
