## Goodbye Chevereto-Free

We are deeply sorry to inform that **we will stop maintaining Chevereto-Free on 2021-12-31** and we won't produce any more releases for it. We are very sad for doing this, but kindly note that we are just a small 2-person team from Chile and we can't afford to gift this edition any longer. We are now focused exclusively in our [paid edition](https://chevereto.com/pricing), **thanks for your support**.

Four long years we tried to make this feasible, it just didn't worked for us. Many thanks for using our software! Hope you enjoyed the experience.
