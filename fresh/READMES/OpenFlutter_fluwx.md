## Preparation

`Fluwx` is good but not God. You'd better read [official documents](https://open.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/showdocument?action=dir_list&t=resource/res_list&verify=1) before
integrating `Fluwx`. Then you'll understand how to generate Android signature, what's universal link for iOS, how to add URL schema for iOS and so on.

## Install

Add the following dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

`Fluwx` with pay:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluwx: ^${latestVersion}
```
![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/fluwx.svg)

`Fluwx` without pay:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fluwx_no_pay: ^${latestVersion}
```

![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/fluwx_no_pay.svg)

> NOTE: Never forget to replace ^${latestVersion} with actual version.

## Register WxAPI

Register your app via `fluwx` if necessary.

```dart
registerWxApi(appId: "wxd930ea5d5a228f5f",universalLink: "https://your.univerallink.com/link/");
```

The param `universalLink` only works with iOS. You can read [this document](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Mobile_App/Access_Guide/iOS.html) to learn
how to create universalLink. You can also learn how to add URL schema, how to add `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` in your iOS project. This is essential.

For Android, you shall know to how generate signature for your app in [this page](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/doc/oplatform/Downloads/Android_Resource.html).
And you have to understand the difference between debug signature and release signature. Once the signature is incorrect, then you'll get `errCode = -1`.

## Capability Document

- [Basic knowledge](./doc/BASIC_KNOWLEDGE.md)
- [Share](./doc/SHARE.md)
- [Payment](./doc/PAYMENT.md)
