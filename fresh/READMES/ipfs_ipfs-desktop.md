## Features

IPFS Desktop combines a complete IPFS node (running [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)) and the [IPFS Web UI](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui) into a single, convenient desktop app — plus adds a menu to your OS menubar/system tray for easy access to a variety of common IPFS tasks.

If you already have an IPFS node on your computer, IPFS Desktop will act as a control panel and file browser for that node. If you don't have a node, it'll install one for you. And either way, IPFS Desktop will automatically check for updates.

### Start your node at system startup and control it from your OS

IPFS Desktop enables you to stop or restart your node straight from the IPFS logo menu in your OS menubar/system tray. For Mac and Windows users, IPFS Desktop can be also be set to launch at system startup, ensuring that your node is running whenever your computer is on.

### Quickly import files, folders, and screenshots to IPFS

Import files and folders to your IPFS node in a variety of convenient ways:
- Drag and drop items onto IPFS Desktop's `Files` screen
- Click the `Import` button on the `Files` screen to add items from your computer or an IPFS [content ID (CID)](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/#identifier-formats)
- (Windows) Right-click a file/folder's icon to add it to IPFS from the pop-up menu
- (Mac) Drag and drop a file/folder onto the IPFS logo in your menubar

Plus, you can use the `Take Screenshot` command under the IPFS logo menu to take a screenshot, import it to your node, and copy a shareable link to your clipboard with one click.

### Easily manage the contents of your node

IPFS Desktop's `Files` screen gives you an easy, familiar interface for working with the contents of your node:
- Easily rename, move, or remove files and folders
- Preview many common file formats directly in IPFS Desktop
- Copy a file/folder's IPFS [content ID (CID)](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/#identifier-formats) or a shareable link to your clipboard
- ["Pin"](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/) files to your IPFS node or (coming soon!) to a third-party pinning service

### Quick download for CIDs, IPFS paths, and IPNS paths

Just want to download an IPFS content ID or IPFS/IPNS content path? Choose `Download...` from the IPFS logo menu, paste it in, and you're good to go.

### Visualize your IPFS peers worldwide

Visit the `Peers` screen to see what nodes you're connected to, where they are, the connections they're using, and more.

### Explore the "Merkle Forest" of IPFS files

Use the `Explore` screen to explore some example datasets — or your own files — and see firsthand how items stored on IPFS are broken down into content-addressed pieces.

### Enjoy OS-wide support for IPFS files and links

IPFS Desktop enables most operating systems (Mac, Windows and some Linux flavors) to support protocols including `ipfs://` and `ipns://`. This means that if an app on your computer tries to open a link starting with one of those protocol identifiers (for example, if your web browser encounters a link to `ipns://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org`), it'll automatically open in IPFS Desktop.

For an even better experience with `ipfs://`, and `ipns://` addresses, we also recommend installing [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion) to add support in your favorite browser!

### Learn IPFS commands as you go

If you're interested in learning how to use IPFS from the command line, IPFS Desktop's CLI Tutor Mode can show you common IPFS commands as you go. Just check the `CLI Tutor Mode` box on the `Settings` screen to switch on this feature.

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Why am I missing the system tray menu on Linux?

IPFS Desktop is built using Electron, and unfortunately, poor system tray support has been a [longstanding problem with Electron apps](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21445).  

You may wish to try troubleshooting according to the [Electron v9.3.0 docs](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v9.3.0/docs/api/tray.md#class-tray):

- On Linux, the app indicator will be used if it is supported; otherwise `GtkStatusIcon` will be used
- On Linux distributions that only have app indicator support, you must install `libappindicator1` to make the tray icon work

If you've noticed that the old system tray is back in IPFS Desktop v0.13, this is because the Electron team [removed support for `StatusNotifier` and restored the old tray interface on Linux called `XEmbed`](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21445#issuecomment-634163402).

### Why can't I start IPFS Desktop under Debian 10?

Some Linux users may see one of the following errors when trying to launch IPFS Desktop:

When launching by double-clicking the app icon:
> The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly.
Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that
chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.

When launching from the terminal:
```console
$ ipfs-desktop
$Trace/breakpoint trap
```

This is a known issue with Electron/Chrome and some hardened kernels. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues/1362#issuecomment-596857282), but a fix is to start IPFS Desktop from the terminal with the following additional parameter:
```console
$ ipfs-desktop --no-sandbox
```

### Where are my IPFS configuration and log files?

You can open these files from the IPFS logo menu by selecting `Open Logs Directory` or `Open Configuration File` from the `Advanced` submenu. Or, find them in your OS as follows:
- **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/IPFS Desktop/`
- **Windows:** `%appdata%/IPFS Desktop/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/IPFS Desktop/`

### How does IPFS Desktop select the IPFS repo location?

IPFS Desktop uses [ipfsd-ctl](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl), which, by default, checks the `IPFS_PATH` environment variable. If that isn't set, it falls back to `$HOME/.ipfs`. As soon as the first run has succeded, repository location info is saved in the configuration file, which becomes the source of truth.

To open your repo directory from the IPFS logo menu, select `Open Repository Directory` from the `Advanced` submenu.

### Which version of IPFS does IPFS Desktop use?

IPFS Desktop includes its own embedded binary (with version defined in `package.json`); this is the latest version of [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) that has passed QA for IPFS Desktop use.

You can check which version of IPFS you're running from the IPFS logo menu by looking in the `About` submenu.

### Which flags does IPFS Desktop boot with?

By default, IPFS Desktop starts the IPFS daemon with the flags `--migrate=true --routing=dhtclient ----enable-gc=true`. 

You can change this in the IPFS Desktop config file by selecting `Open Configuration File` from the `Advanced` submenu.

### I need more help!

If you need help with using IPFS Desktop, the quickest way to get answers is to post them in the [official IPFS forums](https://discuss.ipfs.io). 

If you think you've found a bug or other issue with IPFS Desktop itself, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues/new/choose).
