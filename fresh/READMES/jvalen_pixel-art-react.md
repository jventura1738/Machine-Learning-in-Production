## Did you know that you can create pixel art using CSS?

**Pixel Art to CSS** is an online editor that helps you with that task.

Combining the power of both **box-shadow** and **keyframes** CSS properties, you will get CSS code ready to use in your site.

Furthermore, you can download your work in different formats such as a static image, animated GIF or sprite like image.

**Pixel Art to CSS** aims to be an intuitive tool by its simplicity, however it is equipped with a wide range of features: customize your color palette, go back and forth in time, modify animation settings, save or load your projects, among others.

## Example

By default, you will find the following project within the <b>LOAD</b> section:

![Cat animation example](screenshots/animation-cat.gif)

See it live at [pixelartcss](https://www.pixelartcss.com/)

You can also import it directly submitting [this](examples/import-export/cat.txt) code.

## Technical overview

This application has been built with the following technologies:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): Library to build the UI.
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/): Implements a Flux like architecture.
- [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) Helps to keep the data immutable aiming to avoid side effects.
- [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) Handle the app CSS.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [Express](http://expressjs.com/) (Server side to build an universal application, create and serve the generated drawings).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

If you just want to develop the interface with no need of the back-end side.

```bash
npm run development
```

## Deploy

Create the final build and run the generated React HTML on the server using SSR.

```bash
npm run deploy

npm run server
```

A `config.json` is needed for deployment with the Twitter and express keys.

## Lint

There are several libraries used in the project that help us to keep our codebase healthy:

- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/)
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

Every time we commit something it will execute the linters and format the staged files if needed.

If you want to check them individually you could execute the following scripts:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run csslint
npm run format
```

## Testing

We are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the testing platform.

```bash
npm run test
```
