An-Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning is one of the most popular books among data scientists to learn the conepts and intuitions behind
machine learning algorithms, however, the exercises are implemented in R language, which is a hinderence for all those who are using python
language. To overcome this i have tried solving all the questions in practical exerices in Python language, so people using python language
can also get the most our of this amazing book. Along with that i have also provided the solutions for conceptual questions.
I had tried my best to write the correct solutions to the problem, It was a challenge, and i need to learn to do a lot of research. I do not gurantee that all the solutions are
absoletely correct. I have commented the notebooks.
If you find any query, do send a feedback about the same. Suggestions and corrections are welcome.

Happy Learning!
