## Introduction

### Preface

Researchers always have to read a lot of literature, and understanding the content of the literature has become the norm in scientific research life. However, when we copy the PDF content and paste it into the webpage translation, there may be extra line breaks that lead to garbled translation, and the translation does not match the Chinese reading habits. The translation results are very poor and  you need to manually delete the line break, and `CopyTranslator` can help us solve this problem quickly and perfectly.

Just open the `CopyTranslator` and copy the PDF text to clipboard,  `CopyTranslator` will watch the clipboard changes, then it will process the clipboard contents (such as removing extra line breaks, etc.) and display the translation results. The translation effect is greatly improved compared to the direct copy and paste to the web version of the translation, and the time required for translation is greatly reduced. With the powerful Google translation API, the translation quality is guaranteed. There are also a wealth of options you can set, such as automatically copy translation results to the clipboard, [Incremental Copy](#Incremental-Copy), [Smart Translation](#Smart-Translation), etc., it effectively improve people's reading and translation efficiency of foreign literature.

**After several iterations, `CopyTranslator` has became more and more powerful as well as user-friendly. It is recommended to read the full [User Manual](https://copytranslator.gitee.io/guide/) to make best use of it**.

### Core usage

**Open a webpage/PDF, select the text to be translated, copy the text to the clipboard, `CopyTranslator` will listens to the clipboard change, and  process the clipboard content (such as removing extra line breaks, etc.), translate it, and display**.  Just copy the text,`CopyTranslator` will immediately give the translation result, effectively improving your work efficiency.**
