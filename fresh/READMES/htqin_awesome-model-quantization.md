## Our_Team

Our team is part of the DIG group of the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment ([SKLSDE](http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/)), supervised Prof. [Xianglong Liu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~xlliu/). The main research goals of our team is compressing and accelerating models under multiple scenes.




### Members

[**Haotong Qin**](https://htqin.github.io/)

* Haotong Qin is a Ph.D. student in the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment (SKLSDE) and Shen Yuan Honors College at Beihang University, supervised by Prof. [Wei Li](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~liwei/) and Prof. [Xianglong Liu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~xlliu/). I obtained a B.Eng degree in computer science and engineering from Beihang University, and interned at the MSRA and Tencent WXG. I'm interested in hardware-friendly deep learning and neural network quantization. And my research goal is to enable state-of-the-art neural network models to be deployed on resource-limited hardware, which includes the compression and acceleration for multiple architectures, and the flexible and efficient deployment on multiple hardware.

**Xiangguo Zhang** 

* Xiangguo Zhang is a graduate student in the School of Computer Science of Beihang University, under the guidance of Prof. [Xianglong Liu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~xlliu/). He received a bachelor's degree from Shandong University in 2019 and entered Beihang University in the same year. Currently, he is interested in computer vision and post training quantization.

**Yifu Ding**

* Yifu Ding is a senior student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University. She is in the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment ([SKLSDE](http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/)), under the supervision of Prof. [Xianglong Liu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~xlliu/). Currently, she is interested in computer vision and model quantization. She thinks that neural network models which are highly compressed can be deployed on resource-constrained devices. And among all the compression methods, quantization is a potential one.

**Xiuying Wei**

* Xiuying Wei is a first-year graduate student at Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. [Xianglong Liu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~xlliu/). She recevied a bachelor’s degree from Shandong University in 2020. Currently, she is interested in model quantization. She thinks that quantization could make model faster and more robust, which could put deep learning systems on low-power devices and bring more opportunity for future.

**Qinghua Yan**

* I am a senior student in the Sino-French Engineer School at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/). I just started the research on model compression in the Skate Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment ([SKLSDE](http://www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/)), under the supervision of Prof. [Xianglong Liu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~xlliu/). I have great enthusiasm for deep learning and model quantization and I really enjoy working with my talented teammates.

### Alumnus

**[Ruihao Gong](https://xhplus.github.io/)**

* Ruihao Gong is currently a senior researcher at SenseTime. Before this, he studied at Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. [Xianglong Liu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~xlliu/). Since 2017, he worked on the build-up of computer vision systems and model quantization as an intern at Sensetime Research, where he enjoyed working with the talented researchers and grew up a lot with the help of [Fengwei Yu](http://forwil.xyz/), [Wei Wu](https://wuwei-ai.org/), [Jing Shao](https://amandajshao.github.io/), and [Junjie Yan](https://yan-junjie.github.io/). During the early time of the internship, he independently took responsibility for the development of intelligent video analysis system Sensevideo. Later, he started the research on model quantization which can speed up the inference and even the training of neural networks on edge devices. Now he is devoted to further promoting the accuracy of extremely low-bit models and the auto-deployment of quantized models.
