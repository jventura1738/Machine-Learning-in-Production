**query-json** is a [faster](#Performance), simpler and more portable implementation of the [jq language](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/jq-Language-Description) in [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/native) distributed as a dependency-free binary thanks to the OCaml compiler, and distributed to the web with [js_of_ocaml](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml).

**query-json** allows you to write small programs to operate on top of json files with a concise syntax.

## Purpose

It was created with mostly two reasons, learning and having fun.

- **Learn how to write a Programming Language with the OCaml stack** using `menhir` and `sedlex` with great error messages.
- **Create a CLI tool in Reason Native** and being able to distribute it as a binary (for performance) and as a JavaScript library (for portability).

## It brings

- **Great Performance**: Fast, small footprint and minimum run-time. Check [Performance section](#Performance) for a longer explanation.
- **Delightful errors**:
  - Better errors when json types and operation don't match:
    ```bash
    $ query-json '.esy.release.wat' esy.json
    Error:  Trying to ".wat" on an object, that don't have the field "wat":
    { "bin": ... }
    ```
  - `debug` prints the tokens and the AST.
  - `verbose` flag, prints each operation in each state and it's intermediate states. _(Work in progress...)_
- **Improved API**: made small adjustments to the buildin operations. Some examples are:
  - All methods are snake_case instead of alltoghetercase
  - Added `filter(p)` as an alias for `map(select(p))`
  - Supports comments in JSONs
- **Small**: Lexer, Parser and Compiler are just 300 LOC and most of the commands that I use on my day to day are implemented in only 140 LOC.

## Installation

### Using a bash script

Check the content of [scripts/install.sh](./scripts/install.sh) before running anything in your local. [Friends don't let friends curl | bash](https://sysdig.com/blog/friends-dont-let-friends-curl-bash).
```bash
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davesnx/query-json/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Using npm/yarn

```bash
npm install --global @davesnx/query-json
# or
yarn global add @davesnx/query-json
```

### Download zip files from [GitHub](https://github.com/davesnx/query-json/releases)

## Usage

I recommend to write the query in single-quotes inside the terminal, since writting JSON requires double-quotes for accessing properties.

> NOTE: I have aliased query-json to be "q" for short, you can set it in your dotfiles. `alias q="query-json"`.

#### query a json file
```bash
q '.' pokemons.json
```

#### query from stdin
```bash
cat pokemons.json | q '.'
```

#### query a json inlined
```bash
q --kind=inline '.' '{ "bulvasur": { "id": 1, "power": 20 } }'
```

#### query without colors
```bash
q '.' pokemons.json --no-colors
```

## Performance

[This report](./benchmarks/report.md) is not an exhaustive performance report of both tools, it's a overview for the percieved performance of the user. Here I don't profile each tool and try to see what are the bootlenecks, since I assume that both tools have the penalty of parsing a JSON file. Simply run a bash script and analyze the results.

Aside from that, **query-json** doesn't have feature parity with **jq** which is ok at this point, but **jq** contains a ton of functionality that query-json misses. Adding the missing operations on **query-json** won't affect the performance of it, that could not be true for features like "modules" or "tests", which they will not be implemented in **query-json**.

The report shows that **query-json** is between 2x and 5x faster than **jq** in all operations tested and same speed (~1.1x) with huge files (> 100M).
