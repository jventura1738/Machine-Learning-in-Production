## Read me first

The **current** version of this project is licensed under both [LGPLv3] (or later) and [ASL 2.0]. The old version
(2.0.x) was licensed under [LGPL 3.0][LGPLv3] (or later) only.

**Version 2.2 is out**. See [here](https://github.com/java-json-tools/json-schema-validator/wiki/Whatsnew_22)
for the list of changes compared to 2.0. And of course, it still has [all the
features](https://github.com/java-json-tools/json-schema-validator/wiki/Features) of older versions.

## What this is

This is an implementation with complete validation support for the latest JSON Schema draft (v4,
including hyperschema syntax support) and the previous draft (v3 -- no hyperschema support though).
Its list of features would be too long to enumerate here; please refer to the links above!

Should you wonder about it, this library is reported to [work on
Android](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14511468/java-android-validate-string-json-against-string-schema).
Starting with version 2.2.x, all APK conflicts have been resolved, so you can use this in this
context as well.

## Google Group

This project has a dedicated [Google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/json-schema-validator). For any questions
you have about this software package, feel free to post! The author (me) will try and respond in a
timely manner.

## Testing online

You can [test this library online](http://json-schema-validator.herokuapp.com); this web site is in
a [project of its own](https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator-demo), which you can fork and
run by yourself.

## Versioning scheme policy

The versioning scheme is defined by the **middle digit** of the version number:

* if this number is **even**, then this is the **stable** version; no new features will be
  added to such versions, and the user API will not change (save for some additions if requested).
* if this number is **odd**, then this is the **development** version; new features will be
  added to those versions only, **and the user API may change**.

## Relevant documents

This implementation is based on the following drafts:

* [JSON Schema Internet draft, version 4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04)
  ([link to validation spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00));
* [JSON Schema Internet draft, version 3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03);
