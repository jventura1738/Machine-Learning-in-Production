# How to build TypeScript mono-repo project
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Quramy/lerna-yarn-workspaces-example.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Quramy/lerna-yarn-workspaces-example)

## Tools

* yarn: NPM client.
* Lerna: Multiple packages management tool.
* TypeScript: `^3.0.0` supports project references.

- *If you use ts(<= 2.9), see [ts-2.x branch](https://github.com/Quramy/lerna-yarn-workspaces-example/blob/ts-2.x/README.md)*.
- *If you want to use npm workspaces, see https://github.com/Quramy/npm-ts-workspaces-example*.

## Directory Structure

Put each package under the `packages` directory.

```

## Workspaces

Using [yarn workspace feature](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces), configure the following files:

* /package.json

Append the `workspaces` key.

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

* lerna.json

Set `npmClient` `"yarn"` and turn `useWorkspaces` on.

```json
{
  "lerna": "2.2.0",
  "packages": [
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "npmClient": "yarn",
  "useWorkspaces": true,
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Exec `yarn install`(or `lerna bootstrap`). After successful running, all dependency packages are downloaded under the repository root `node_modules` directory.

### Dependencies between packages
In this example, the `x-cli` package depends on another package, `x-core`. So to execute (or test) `x-cli`, `x-core` packages should be installed.
But in development the `x-core` package is not published so you can't install it.

`yarn` solves this problem. This command creates sim-links of each package into the top-level `node_modules` dir.

## Resolve Dependencies as TypeScript Modules
As mentioned above, Lerna resolves dependencies between packages. It's enough for "runtime". However considering TypeScript sources, in other words "static", it's not.

For example, the following code depends a module `x-core` located at other package.

```ts
/* packages/x-cli/src/main.ts */
import { awesomeFn } from "@quramy/x-core";

export function cli() {
  awesomeFn();
  return Promise.resolve(true);
}
```

If you compile this code, TypeScript compiler emits a "Cannot find module" error until building `x-core` package and creating `x-core/index.d.ts`. And it's silly to compile dependent packages(e.g. `x-core`) in the same repository after each editing them.

[TypeScript's path mapping](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping) is the best solution. Path mappings are declared such as:

```js
/* tsconfig.json */
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* other options */
    "baseUrl": "./packages",
    "paths": {
      "@quramy/*": ["./*/src"]
    }
  }
}
```

The above setting means `import { awesomeFn } from "@quramy/x-core"` is mapped to `import { awesomeFn } from "../../x-core/src"`(it's relative from "packages/x-cli/src/main.ts"). In other words, path mapping allows to treat developing packages' sources as published(compiled) modules.

### References between packages
TypeScript 3.0 supports [Project reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) feature. You can tell tsc that `x-cli` depends on `x-core` project using this.

```js
/* packages/x-cli/tsconfig.json */
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "src",
    "outDir": "lib"
  },
  "references": [
    { "path": "../x-core" }
  ]
}
```

In the above json, the key `references` means the dependency.

### Compile all packages

Our repository has multiple `tsconfig.json` files. We can compile all packages with "-b" option:

```sh
$ tsc -b packages/x-core packages/x-cli
```
