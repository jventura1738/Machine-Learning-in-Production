## Maintenance Notice
Hi, I was not able to look to issues for a while because I'm in the military and I will back in 26 August, until that time you can maintain the GDBFrontend project if you are interested.

## Installing

### Requirements
* GDB => 8.2 (with python3)
* python3 => 3.2
* tmux

### PIP Package (Python Wheel)
You can install GDBFrontend with `pip`.

```bash
python3 -m pip install gdbfrontend
```

### GDBFrontend Python API
You can access GDBFrontend's Python API via `gdbfrontend` module.

```
(gdb) python-interactive
```
```python
>>> dir(gdbfrontend)
```

For example, you can get all client sockets like this:
```python
>>> gdbfrontend.api.globalvars.httpServer.ws_clients
{1: <server.GDBFrontendSocket object at 0x...>}
```

or you can get all plugins:
```python
>>> gdbfrontend.plugin.getAll()
['hello', 'theme_light', 'theme_red']
```

## Security with Sharing Sessions
You can use `--credentials=USER:PASS` option for adding HTTP authentication to your debugger session.
**Note:** Your browser will ask same credentials for two times.

## Troubleshooting
### Blocking GDB shell/main-thread
Most of GDBFrontend functions are thread-safe and work on GDB's main-thread. So, if you run something that is blocking on the GDB shell, GDBFrontend functions have to wait it until finish.

You will get this warning when a thread-safe GDBFrontend function needs to work and you are blocking GDB's main thread.
```bash
(gdb) shell
$ ...
[GDBFrontend] GDB main thread is bloocking. (If you are running something (like shell) in GDB shell, you must terminate it for GDBFrontend to continue work properly.)
```

When you exit shell, blocking GDBFrontend functions will continue working.

### Zombie Processes
Sometimes GDB and gdb-frontend may not be closed correctly. In this case, you can terminate gdb-frontend shell.

```bash
tmux kill-session -t gdb-frontend
```

### Expression Evaluater Performance Tips
If you are using **ExpressionEvaluater** with very long depth expanded variables/members, your scroll and evaluater window move performance may be affected bad for pointer visualization. In this situation, you can turn off **signal** and **slot** pointings for that evaluater window.

## GDB-Related Issues and Tips
* GDB does not give sources of linked object **until stepping a line that calls a function from the linked object once**.
You can add break point a line and step it once, then you will see sources from linked object hereafter during the session.

## Windows
In fact, gdb-frontend is able to run on Windows but there are some serious issues in the GDB's Windows version those avoid using gdb-frontend on Windows. Of course you can use gdb-frontend on WSL if you are using Windows 10.

### Issues about Windows-GDB

* GDB's main-thread is being blocked during running process. (gdb-frontend has an interrupting mechanism to fixing this but it is not enough yet.)
* Windows-GDB's prompt is being blocked during running process and there are some issues about interrupting the application.

## WSL
You can use gdb-frontend on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

### Issues about WSL
* On WSL 1, Random port option is not usable on WSL becasue `/proc/net/tcp` interface is not working on WSL. (WSL 2 does not has this problem.)

## Versioning
Since v0.2.0-beta, GDBFrontend switched to a new versioning strategy.

### Reading Versions
In `vX.Y.Z-STABILITY`:
* `X` is **major** versions, changes long term with major features and enhancements.
* `Y` is **main** versions that include new features and enhancements.
* `Z` is **bugfix** releases of main versions.
* `STABILITY` is stability level of the release. (`alpha`, `beta`, `rcN`, `stable`)
