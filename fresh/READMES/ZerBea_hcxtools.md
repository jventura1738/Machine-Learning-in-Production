hcxtools
==============

Small set of tools convert packets from captures (h = hash, c = capture, convert and
calculate candidates, x = different hashtypes) for the use with latest hashcat
or John the Ripper. The tools are 100% compatible to hashcat and John the Ripper
and recommended by hashcat. This branch is pretty closely synced to hashcat git branch
(that means: latest hcxtools matching on latest hashcat beta) and John the Ripper
git branch ("bleeding-jumbo").

Support for hashcat hash-modes: 4800, 5500, 2200x, 16100, 250x (deprecated), 1680x (deprecated)
  
Support for John the Ripper hash-modes: WPAPSK-PMK, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1, chap, netntlm, tacacs-plus

After capturing, upload the "uncleaned" dump file (pcapng, pcap, cap) here https://wpa-sec.stanev.org/?submit
to see if your ap or the client is vulnerable by using common wordlists.
To reduce dump file size, gzip (.gz) compression is supported.
Convert the dump file to WPA-PBKDF2-PMKID+EAPOL hash file and check if wlan-key
or plainmasterkey was transmitted unencrypted.


Brief description
--------------

Multiple stand-alone binaries - designed to run on  Arch Linux.

All of these utils are designed to execute only one specific function.

Work flow
--------------

hcxdumptool -> hcxpcapngtool -> hcxhashtool (additional hcxpsktool/hcxeiutool) -> hashcat or JtR

hcxdumptool: attack and capture everything (depending on options)

hcxpcapngtool: convert everything

hcxhashtool: filter hashes

hcxpsktool: get weak PSK candidates

hcxeiutool: calculate wordlists from ESSID
 
hashcat or JtR: get PSK from hash

* gcc 10 recommended (deprecated versions are not supported: https://gcc.gnu.org/)

* libopenssl and openssl-dev installed

* librt and librt-dev installed (should be installed by default)

* zlib and zlib-dev installed (for gzip compressed cap/pcap/pcapng files)

Useful scripts
--------------

| Script       | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| piwritecard  | Example script to restore SD-Card                        |
| piwreadcard  | Example script to backup SD-Card                         |
| hcxgrep.py   | Extract records from hccapx/pmkid file based on regexp   |


Notice
--------------

Most output files will be appended to existing files (with the exception of pcapng, pcap, cap files).

It is recommended to use hash mode 22000 (22001) instead of deprecated hash modes 2500 (2501) and 16800 (16801)


Bitmask message pair field (hcxpcapngtool)
--------------

bit 0-2

000 = M1+M2, EAPOL from M2 (challenge)

001 = M1+M4, EAPOL from M4 if not zeroed (authorized)

010 = M2+M3, EAPOL from M2 (authorized)

011 = M2+M3, EAPOL from M3 (authorized) - unused"

100 = M3+M4, EAPOL from M3 (authorized) - unused"

101 = M3+M4, EAPOL from M4 if not zeroed (authorized)"

3: reserved

4: ap-less attack (set to 1) - no nonce-error-corrections necessary

5: LE router detected (set to 1) - nonce-error-corrections only for LE necessary

6: BE router detected (set to 1) - nonce-error-corrections only for BE necessary

7: not replaycount checked (set to 1) - replaycount not checked, nonce-error-corrections definitely necessary
