# WPF-Samples
This repo contains the samples that demonstrate the API usage patterns and popular features for the Windows Presentation Foundation in the .NET Core for Desktop. These samples were initially hosted on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/ms771633.aspx), and we are gradually 
moving all the interesting WPF samples over to GitHub. All the samples have been retargeted to  [.NET Core 3.0](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk).

You can also find an archive of samples targeting .NET 4.7.2 in the [netframework](https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples/tree/netframework) branch.

The samples in this repo are generally about illustrating specific concepts and may go against accessibility best practices. However, the team has spent some time illustrating accessibility best practices in a subset of these samples.

## WPF development

These samples require Visual Studio 2019 to build, test, and deploy, and also require the .NET Core 3 SDK.

   [Get a free copy of Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition with support for building WPF apps](https://www.visualstudio.com/wpf-vs)

   [.NET Core SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)

WPF on .NET Core 3.0 has been open-sourced, and is now available on [Github](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)

**Note:** If you are using the latest version of Visual Studio 2019 (16.9.0 and above), the .NET Core 3 SDK must be downloaded and installed manually to successfully build these samples. You can find installers for the .NET Core 3 SDK at the [github](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk) or at <https://dot.net/core>
   
## Using the samples

To use the samples with Git, clone the WPF-Samples repository with 'git clone https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples'

After cloning the WPF-Samples respository, there will be two solution files in the root directory: WPF-Samples.sln and WPF-Samples.msbuild.sln 

* To build the samples, open one of the solution files in Visual Studio 2019 and build the solution.
* Alternatively, navigate to the directory of a sample and build with 'dotnet build' or 'msbuild' specifying the target project file. 
* WPF-Samples.msbuild.sln contains projects that can be built only with `msbuild` or Visual Studio, and will not compile with `dotnet build`. These projects contain C++ code, for which there is no support in `dotnet build`

The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the link below or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in Visual Studio 2019.

   [Download the samples ZIP](../../archive/master.zip)

   **Notes:** 
   * Before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select Properties, and then select Unblock.
   * Most samples should work independently
   * By default, all the samples target .NET core 3.0. (Installers for the .NET core 3 SDK can be found at <https://dot.net/core>)

For more info about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in these samples, please refer to the guidance  available in  [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130.aspx). These samples are provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for WPF.
