## About

discord.js is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the
[Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

- Object-oriented
- Predictable abstractions
- Performant
- 100% coverage of the Discord API

## Installation

**Node.js 14.0.0 or newer is required.**  

```sh-session
npm install discord.js
```

### Optional packages

- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for WebSocket data compression and inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)
- [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack) for significantly faster WebSocket data (de)serialisation (`npm install discord/erlpack`)
- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install bufferutil`)
- [utf-8-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) in combination with `bufferutil` for much faster WebSocket processing (`npm install utf-8-validate`)
- [@discordjs/voice](https://github.com/discordjs/voice) for interacting with the Discord Voice API

## Example usage

```js
const { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS, Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES] });

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
});

client.on('messageCreate', message => {
  if (message.content === 'ping') {
    message.channel.send('pong');
  }
});

client.login('token');
```
