:construction: __NOTE:__ Revery is a work-in-progress and in active development! :construction:

To get a taste of Revery, check out our JavaScript + WebGL build on the [playground](https://outrunlabs.com/revery/playground). For the best experience, though, you'll want to try a [native build](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/wiki/Building-&-Installing).

## Motivation

Today, [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is one of the most popular tools for building desktop apps - using an HTML, JS, CSS stack. However, it has a heavy footprint in terms of both RAM and CPU - __essentially packing an entire browser into the app.__ Even with that tradeoff, it has a lot of great aspects - it's the quickest way to build a cross-platform app & it provides a great development experience - as can be testified by its usage in popular apps like VSCode, Discord, and Slack.

Revery is kind of like super-fast, _native code_ Electron - with bundled React-like/Redux-like libraries and a fast build system - all ready to go!

Revery is built with [reasonml](https://reasonml.github.io), which is a javascript-like syntax on top of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) This means that the language is accessible to JS developers.

Your apps are compiled to native code with the Reason / OCaml toolchain - with __instant startup__ and __performance comparable to native C code.__ Revery features platform-accelerated, GPU-accelerated rendering. The compiler itself is fast, too!

Revery is an experiment - can we provide a great developer experience and help teams be productive, without making sacrifices on performance?

### Design Decisions

- __Consistent cross-platform behavior__

A major value prop of Electron is that you can build for all platforms at once. You have great confidence as a developer that your app will look and work the same across different platforms. Revery is the same - aside from platform-specific behavior, if your app looks or behaves differently on another platform, that's a bug! As a consequence, Revery is like [flutter](https://flutter.io) in that it __does not use native widgets__. This means more work for us, but also that we have more predictable functionality cross-platform!

> __NOTE:__ If you're looking for something that does leverage native widgets, check out [briskml](https://github.com/briskml/brisk). Another alternative is the [cuite](https://github.com/let-def/cuite) OCaml binding for [Qt](https://github.com/let-def/cuite).

- __High performance__

Performance should be at the forefront, and not a compromise - we need to develop and build benchmarks that help ensure top-notch performance and start-up time.

- __Type-safe, functional code__

We might have some dirty mutable objects for performance - but our high-level API should be purely functional. You should be able to follow the React model of modelling your UI as a _pure function_ of application state -> UI.

# Hot reload

We don't have a Hot Reload yet but it is on our roadmap. In the meantime, you can check branch [feat/hot-reload](https://github.com/revery-ui/revery/tree/feat/hot-reload) to see the progression.

In the meantime @mbernat has done a [script](https://gist.github.com/mbernat/abf651653c123374037c27377f41d0a0) that allow to relaunch the APP when the binary changed.
