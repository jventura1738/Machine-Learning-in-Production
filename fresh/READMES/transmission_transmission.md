## About

Transmission is a fast, easy, and free BitTorrent client. It comes in several flavors:
  * A native Mac OS X GUI application
  * GTK+ and Qt GUI applications for Linux, BSD, etc.
  * A headless daemon for servers and routers
  * A web UI for remote controlling any of the above

Visit https://transmissionbt.com/ for more information.

## Command line interface notes

Transmission is fully supported in transmission-remote, the preferred cli client.

Three standalone tools to examine, create, and edit .torrent files exist: transmission-show, transmission-create, and transmission-edit, respectively.

Prior to development of transmission-remote, the standalone client transmission-cli was created. Limited to a single torrent at a time, transmission-cli is deprecated and exists primarily to support older hardware dependent upon it. In almost all instances, transmission-remote should be used instead.

Different distributions may choose to package any or all of these tools in one or more separate packages.

## Building

Transmission has an Xcode project file (Transmission.xcodeproj) for building in Xcode.

For a more detailed description, and dependencies, visit: https://github.com/transmission/transmission/wiki

### Building a Transmission release from the command line

    $ tar xf transmission-2.92.tar.xz
    $ cd transmission-2.92
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

### Building Transmission from the nightly builds

Download a tarball from https://build.transmissionbt.com/job/trunk-linux/ and follow the steps from the previous section.

If you're new to building programs from source code, this is typically easier than building from Git.

### Building Transmission from Git (first time)

    $ git clone https://github.com/transmission/transmission Transmission
    $ cd Transmission
    $ git submodule update --init
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

### Building Transmission from Git (updating)

    $ cd Transmission/build
    $ make clean
    $ git pull --rebase --prune
    $ git submodule update
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

### Code Style

You would want to setup your editor to make use of the uncrustify.cfg file located in the root of this repository and the eslint/prettier rules in web/package.json.

If for some reason you are unwilling or unable to do so, there is a shell script which you could run either directly or via docker-compose:

    $ ./code_style.sh
    or
    $ docker-compose build --pull
    $ docker-compose run --rm code_style
