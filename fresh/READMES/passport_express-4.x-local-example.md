This example illustrates how to use [Express](https://expressjs.com) 4.x and
[Passport](https://www.passportjs.org) to sign users in with a username and
password.  Use this example as a starting point for your own web applications.

## Quick Start

To get started with this example, clone the repository and install the
dependencies.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/passport/express-4.x-local-example.git
$ cd express-4.x-local-example
$ npm install
```

Start the server.

```bash
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

## Overview

This example illustrates how to use [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org) and
the [`passport-local`](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-local/)
strategy within an [Express](https://expressjs.com) application to sign users in
with a username and password.

The example builds upon the scaffolding created by [Express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html),
and uses [EJS](https://ejs.co) as a view engine and plain CSS for styling.  This
scaffolding was generated by executing:

```
$ express --view ejs express-4.x-local-example
```

The example uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) for storing user accounts.
SQLite is a lightweight database that works well for development, including this
example.

Added to the scaffolding are files which add authentication to the application.

* [`boot/db.js`](boot/db.js)

  This file initializes the database by creating the tables used to store user
  accounts and credentials.
  
* [`boot/auth.js`](boot/auth.js)

  This file initializes Passport.  It configures the password strategy with a
  `verify` callback.  The callback verifies the password by finding the user
  account in the database.  If the account is found, the callback hashes the
  password entered and compares it to the hashed password stored in the
  database.  If the comparison is equal, the user is authenticated.
  
  This file also supplies the serialization functions used for session
  management.

* [`routes/auth.js`](routes/auth.js)

  This file defines the routes used for authentication.  In particular, there
  are two routes used to authenticate with a username and password:
  
  - `GET /login`
  
    This route renders a page that prompts the user to enter their username and
    password.
  
  - `POST /login/password`
  
    This route authenticates the user using their username and password.

* [`routes/users.js`](routes/users.js)

  This file defines the routes used for registration.  In particular, there are
  two routes used to create an account:
  
  - `GET /users/new`
  
    This route renders a page that prompts the user to enter the information
    needed to register an acccount.  This information consists of their name,
    preferred username, and password.
  
  - `POST /users`
  
    This route creates a new account using the information entered by the user.
    The password is first hashed and stored in hashed format.
