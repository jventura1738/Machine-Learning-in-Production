### Reporting issues

The best way to report an issue with a plugin is to find the plugin on https://xbarapp.com and click "Open issue". If possible, the author will be tagged in the issue - which greatly increases your chances of getting the issue looked at quickly.

### How to use them

  * Just drop the plugin into your xbar plugins folder (if you have the repo, why not use the `Enabled` folder?)
  * Make sure it's executable (in Terminal, do `chmod +x plugin.sh`)
  * Then choose `Refresh all` from the xbar menus
