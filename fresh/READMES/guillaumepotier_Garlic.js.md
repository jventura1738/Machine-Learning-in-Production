# Garlic.js

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/guillaumepotier/Garlic.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guillaumepotier/Garlic.js)

Garlic.js allows you to automatically persist your forms' text and select field values locally, until the form is submitted. This way, your users don't lose any precious data if they accidentally close their tab or browser.

# TODO

* Improve doc and api;

# Run tests

* Headless tests: `npm install && npm test`

# Make production minified versions

You'll need ruby, and Google Closure compiler: `gem install closure-compiler`. Then, just call:

`./bin/build.sh version` where version is the build release. eg: `./bin/build.sh 1.1.2`

They'll be created and dumped in the dist/ directory
