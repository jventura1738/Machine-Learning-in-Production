# Control Xiaomi Mi Home Wi-Fi devices
Use [Homey](https://www.athom.com/) to control Xiaomi Mi Home devices (the Mi Home Ecosystem is also branded as MiJia). Currently Xiaomi does not officialy support controlling most of it's devices from outside the Mi Home app with the exception of Yeelights. Yeelights can be added to Homey quite easy but for all other devices additional steps are needed that require technical skills setting up. These steps are described but Xiaomi can make changes to it's eco system at any time resulting in devices that can not be added or controlled by Homey anymore.

This app uses an unofficial library called the [miIO Device Library](https://github.com/aholstenson/miio) for communication with those devices which lack official support for controlling externally, credits go out to the author of this library. This Homey app also only adds support for the devices that can be controlled directly through Wi-Fi, there is a whole range of Mi Home sensors that can only be used together with the Xiaomi Smart Home Gateway (which uses ZigBee) but this is currently out the scope of this app.
