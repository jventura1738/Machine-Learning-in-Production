# OpenSimpleLidar
Open Hardware scanning laser rangefinder.  
Its parameters:  
* 5 scans/second
* 180 measurements per rotation (2 deg anglular resolution)
* Maximum distance - 4 m
* Measured accuracy ~3-5 cm at 3 m (depends upon the color of reflecting surface).

This device is really cheap - its components cost less than $30.  
See "TotalBOM" with price calculations.  
  
Now I'm updating the documentation for this LIDAR.  
Some of it I'm writing to the project wiki: https://github.com/iliasam/OpenSimpleLidar/wiki  

[Please take the simple survey about assembling instructions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/127PN3ydydF8poReQAPeC-vXDqIst-CIAj8u08tnh1lM)

This Lidar is using **triangulation method** for measuring distance to objects. It can be shown by this picture:

Please leave your feedback if you will be able to build this Lidar - I need more feedback about assembing instructions.
