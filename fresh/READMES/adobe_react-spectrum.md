## Features

* ‚ôøÔ∏è **[Accessible](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/accessibility.html)** ‚Äì Accessibility and behavior is implemented according to [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/), including full screen reader and keyboard navigation support. All components have been tested across a wide variety of screen readers and devices to ensure the best experience possible for all users.
* üì± **[Adaptive](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/interactions.html)** ‚Äì All components are designed to work with mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions. They‚Äôre built with responsive design principles to deliver a great experience, no matter the device.
* üåç **[International](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/internationalization.html)** ‚Äì Support over 30 languages is included out of the box, including support for right-to-left languages, date and number formatting, and more.
* üé® **[Customizable](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/theming.html)** ‚Äì React Spectrum components support custom themes, and automatically adapt for dark mode. For even more customizability, you can build your own components with your own DOM structure and styling using the [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) and [React Stately](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/index.html) hooks to provide behavior, accessibility, and interactions.

## Getting started

React Spectrum includes several libraries, which you can choose depending on your usecase.

* [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/getting-started.html) is an implementation of Adobe's design system. If you‚Äôre integrating with Adobe software or would like a complete component library to use in your project, look no further!
* [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html) is a collection of React Hooks that provides accessible UI primitives for use in your own design system. If you're building a component library for the web from scratch with your own styling, start here.
* [React Stately](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/getting-started.html) is a library of state management hooks for use in your component library. If you're using React Aria, you'll likely also use React Stately, but it can also be used independently (e.g. on other platforms like React Native).

## Contributing

One of the goals of the React Spectrum project is to make building design systems and component libraries as easy as possible, while maintaining high quality interactions and accessibility support. We aim to raise the bar for web applications. The best way to achieve that goal is **together**. We would love contributions from the community no matter how big or small. üòç
