Introduction
------------

Open Source Point of Sale is a web based point of sale system.
The main features are:
* Stock management (Items and Kits with extensible list of Attributes)
* VAT, GST, customer and multi tiers taxation
* Sale register with transactions logging
* Quotation and invoicing
* Expenses logging
* Cashup
* Receipt and invoice printing and/or emailing
* Barcode generation and printing
* Suppliers and Customers database
* Multiuser with permission control
* Reporting on sales, orders, expenses, inventory status
* Receivings
* Giftcard
* Rewards
* Restaurant tables
* Messaging (SMS)
* Multilanguage
* Selectable Boostrap (Bootswatch) based UI theme
* Mailchimp integration
* reCAPTCHA to protect login page from brute force attacks
* GDPR ready

The software is written in PHP language, it uses MySQL (or MariaDB) as data storage back-end and has a simple but intuitive user interface.

The latest 3.x version is a complete overhaul of the original software.
It is now based on Bootstrap 3 using Bootswatch themes, and uses CodeIgniter version 3 as framework.
It also has improved functionality and security.

DEMO / DEV
----------

A demo version of the latest master version can be found on our [Demo server](https://demo.opensourcepos.org). This is a containerized install which will be reinitialized when new functionality is added to the code repository.

Beside this we also have a [Dev server](https://dev.opensourcepos.org) that runs the build that was triggered with the last repository's commit.

In case of any issues, check our status page at [status.opensourcepos.org](https://status.opensourcepos.org) to confirm whether there is a sever outage.

Installation
------------

Please **refrain from creating issues** about installation problems **before having read the FAQ and went through existing github issues**. We have a build pipeline that checks the sanity of our latest repository commit and in case the application itself is broken then our build will be as well.

This application **can be setup in many different ways** and we only **support the ones described in the INSTALL file linked below**.

Read the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/blob/master/INSTALL.md) in our repository.

[Check our wiki](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/wiki/Supported-hardware-datasheet) for info and recommendations on supported receipt printers and barcode scanners.

FAQ
---

* If you are seeing the message **system folder missing**, then you have cloned the source using git and you need to run a build *first*. Check [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for instructions or download latest zip file from [PLACEHOLDER](https://NEWURL) instead.

* If at login time you read "The installation is not correct, check your php.ini file.", please check the error_log in public folder to understand what's wrong and make sure you read the [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/blob/master/INSTALL.md). To know how to enable error_log, please read the comment in [issue 1770](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/issues/1770#issuecomment-355177943).

* If you installed your OSPOS under a web server subdir, please edit public/.htaccess and go to the lines with comment `if in web root` and `if in subdir comment above line, uncomment below one and replace <OSPOS path> with your path` and follow the instruction on the second comment line. If you face more issues please read [issue #920](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/issues/920) for more help.

* Apache server configurations are SysAdmin issues and not strictly related to OSPOS. Please make sure you first can show a "hello world" html page before pointing to OSPOS public directory. Make sure .htaccess is correctly configured.

* If the avatar pictures are not shown in Items or at Item save time you get an error, please make sure your public and subdirs are assigned to the correct owner and the access permission is set to 750.

* If you install ospos in docker behind a proxy that performs ssloffloading, you can enable the url generated to be https instead of http, by activating the environment variable FORCE_HTTPS = 1.

* If you have suhosin installed and face an issue with CSRF, please make sure you read [issue #1492](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/issues/1492).

* PHP 8.0 is not currently supported, see [issue #3051](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/issues/3051).

* PHP 5.5 and 5.6 are no longer supported due to the fact that they have been deprecated and not safe to use from security point of view.
