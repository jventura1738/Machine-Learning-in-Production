# whatsapp-web.js
A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app

It uses Puppeteer to run a real instance of Whatsapp Web to avoid getting blocked.

**NOTE:** I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

## Installation

The module is now available on npm! `npm i whatsapp-web.js`

Please note that Node v14+ is required.

## Example usage

```js
const { Client } = require('whatsapp-web.js');

const client = new Client();

client.on('qr', (qr) => {
    // Generate and scan this code with your phone
    console.log('QR RECEIVED', qr);
});

client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log('Client is ready!');
});

client.on('message', msg => {
    if (msg.body == '!ping') {
        msg.reply('pong');
    }
});

client.initialize();
```

## Remote Access

You could also connect to any previously existing browser instance:

```js
const client = new Client({ 
    puppeteer: {
        browserWSEndpoint: `ws://localhost:3000`
    }
});
```

### Docker

1) Installing a browser using browserless:

```
docker run \
  --rm \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e "MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS=1" \
  browserless/chrome:latest
```

Reference: https://docs.browserless.io/docs/docker-quickstart.html

### Remote Debugging

2) Running a browser with websocket remote debugging enabled:
> chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222

After that check the following webpage and check http://127.0.0.1:9220/json and get the **webSocketDebuggerUrl**

Take a look at [example.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/blob/master/example.js) for another example with more use cases.
