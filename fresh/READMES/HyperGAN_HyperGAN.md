## About

HyperGAN builds generative adversarial networks in pytorch and makes them easy to train and share.

For a general introduction to GANs see [http://blog.aylien.com/introduction-generative-adversarial-networks-code-tensorflow/](http://blog.aylien.com/introduction-generative-adversarial-networks-code-tensorflow/)

## Documentation

* [Gitbook documentation](https://hypergan.gitbook.io/)

## Changelog

See the full changelog here: [Changelog.md](changelog.md)

## Quick start

### Requirements

OS: Windows, OSX, Linux

For training:

GPU: Nvidia, GTX 1080+ recommended

### Install

1. Install HyperGAN
  For users: `pip3 install hypergan`

  For developers: Download this repo and run `python3 setup.py develop`

2. Test it out
  * `hypergan train preset:celeba -s 128x128x3`

3. Join the community
  * Once you've made something cool, be sure to share it on the Discord \([https://discord.gg/t4WWBPF](https://discord.gg/t4WWBPF)\).

### Create a new model

```bash
  hypergan new mymodel
```

This will create a mymodel.json based off the default configuration. You can change configuration templates with the `-c` flag.

### List configuration templates

```bash
  hypergan new mymodel -l
```

See all configuration templates with `--list-templates` or `-l`.

### Train

```bash
  hypergan train folder/ -s 32x32x3 -c mymodel --resize
```

## API

```python
import hypergan as hg
```

Note this API is currently under work in 1.0. If you are reading this before 1.0 is released check the examples.

See the [gitbook documentation](https://hypergan.gitbook.io/) for more details.

### Using a trained hypergan model

```python
my_gan = hg.GAN('model.hypergan')
batch_sample = my_gan.sample()
```

### Training a gan

```python
gan = hg.GAN("default.json", inputs=hg.inputs.ImageLoader(...))
trainable_gan = hg.TrainableGAN(gan)
for step in trainable_gan.train():
    print("I'm on step ", step)
```

### Examples

See the examples [https://github.com/hypergan/HyperGAN/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/hypergan/HyperGAN/tree/master/examples)

### Tutorials

See the tutorials [https://hypergan.gitbook.io/hypergan/tutorials](https://hypergan.gitbook.io/hypergan/tutorials)

## The pip package hypergan

```bash
pip install hypergan
```

### Training

```bash
  # Train a 32x32 gan with batch size 32 on a folder of pngs
  hypergan train [folder] -s 32x32x3 -b 32 --config [name]
```

### Sampling

```bash
  hypergan sample [folder] -s 32x32x3 -b 32 --config [name] --sampler batch_walk --save_samples
```

By default hypergan will not save training samples to disk. To change this, use `--save_samples`.

### Additional Arguments

To see a detailed list, run

```bash
  hypergan -h
```

### Running on CPU

You can switch the backend with:

```bash
  hypergan [...] -B cpu
```

Don't train on CPU! It's too slow.

### Troubleshooting

Make sure that your cuda, nvidia drivers, pillow, pytorch, and pytorch vision are the latest version.

Check the discord for help.

### Development mode

If you wish to modify hypergan

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hypergan/hypergan
cd hypergan
python3 setup.py develop
```

Make sure to `pip3 uninstall hypergan` to avoid version conflicts.

## Datasets

To build a new network you need a dataset.

### Creating a Dataset

Datasets in HyperGAN are meant to be simple to create. Just use a folder of images. Nested folders work too.

### Cleaning up data

HyperGAN is built to be resilient to all types of unclean data. By default images are resized then cropped if necessary.

See `--nocrop`, `--random_crop` and `--resize` for additional image scaling options.

## Features

A list of features in the 1.0 release:

* API
* CLI
* Viewer - an electron app to explore and create models
* Cross platform - Windows, OSX, Linux
* Inference - Add AI content generation to your project
* Training - Train custom models using accelerated parallel training backends
* Sharing - Share built models with each other. Use them in python projects as hypergan models, or in any project as onxx models
* Customizable - Define custom architectures in the json, or replace any component with your own pytorch creation
* Data - Built to work on unclean data and multiple data types
* Unsupervised learning
* Unsupervised alignment - Align one distribution to another or discover new novel distributions.
* Transfer learning
* Online learning

## Versioning

HyperGAN uses semantic versioning. [http://semver.org/](http://semver.org/)

TLDR: _x.y.z_

* _x_ is incremented on stable public releases.
* _y_ is incremented on API breaking changes.  This includes configuration file changes and graph construction changes.
* _z_ is incremented on non-API breaking changes.  _z_ changes will be able to reload a saved graph.
