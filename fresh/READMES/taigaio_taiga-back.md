⚠️ Relocation warning
=====================

This repository has been relocated to [the new organization Kaleidos Ventures](https://github.com/kaleidos-ventures/taiga-back/) where the team will continue developing Taiga. Please, follow us and contribute on the new location. New issues should be placed as well under the new Github organization.

We haven't archived this repository yet because we want to keep the issues currently open, but it'll become inactive eventually and so it will be archived.

## Documentation

Currently, we have authored three main documentation hubs:

- **[API](https://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/api.html)**: Our API documentation and reference for developing from Taiga API.
- **[Documentation](https://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/)**: If you need to install Taiga on your own server, this is the place to find some guides.
- **[Taiga Resources](https://resources.taiga.io)**: This page is intended to be the support reference page for the users.

## Bug reports

If you **find a bug** in Taiga you can always report it:

- in [Taiga issues](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issues). **This is the preferred way**
- in [Github issues](https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back/issues)
- send us a mail to support@taiga.io if is a bug related to [tree.taiga.io](https://tree.taiga.io)
- send us a mail to security@taiga.io if is a **security bug**

One of our fellow Taiga developers will search, find and hunt it as soon as possible.

Please, before reporting a bug, write down how can we reproduce it, your operating system, your browser and version, and if it's possible, a screenshot. Sometimes it takes less time to fix a bug if the developer knows how to find it.
