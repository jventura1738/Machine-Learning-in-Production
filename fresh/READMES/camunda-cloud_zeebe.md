[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.camunda.zeebe/camunda-cloud-zeebe/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.camunda.zeebe/camunda-cloud-zeebe)

Zeebe provides visibility into and control over business processes that span multiple microservices. It is the engine that powers [Camunda Cloud](https://camunda.com/products/cloud/workflow-engine/).

**Why Zeebe?**

* Define processes visually in [BPMN 2.0](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/)
* Choose your programming language
* Deploy with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
* Build processes that react to messages from [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) and other message queues
* Scale horizontally to handle very high throughput
* Fault tolerance (no relational database required)
* Export process data for monitoring and analysis
* Engage with an active community

## Release Lifecycle

Our release cadence within major releases is a minor release every three months, with an alpha release on each of the two months between minor releases. Releases happen on the second Tuesday of the month, Berlin time (CET).

Minor releases are supported with patches for six months after their release.

Here is a diagram illustrating the lifecycle of minor releases over a 13-month period:
