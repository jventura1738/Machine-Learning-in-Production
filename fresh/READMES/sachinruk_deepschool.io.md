## [Sign up here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-and-data-science-2021/?referralCode=E79228C7436D74315787) for Udemy Course on Machine Learning (Use code DEEPSCHOOL-MARCH to get 85% off course).


## Goals
1. Make Deep Learning easier (minimal code).
2. Minimise required mathematics.
3. Make it practical (runs on laptops).
4. Open Source Deep Learning Learning.
5. Grow a collaborating practical community around DL.
6. Memes: No seriously. Make DL fun and interactive, this means more Trump tweets.

## Support Us
There's a few ways you can support this initiative:
1. Sign up to the Udemy course above.
2. Subscribe to our [YouTube channel here](http://www.youtube.com/user/sachinabey?sub_confirmation=1).
3. Star this repository and share it!

## Contents
The following contents are each contained within a folder:
1. Data Science (eg. Pandas)
