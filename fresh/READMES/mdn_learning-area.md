# learning-area
Github repo for the [MDN Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn).

Most of the code examples shown and discussed in the Learning Area can be found here; the directories in the repo match the module structure of the articles.

The one exception is the [Server-side website programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side) examples â€” we broke these out into separate repos to make them easier to deal with:

* https://github.com/mdn/express-locallibrary-tutorial
* https://github.com/mdn/django-locallibrary-tutorial
