# Avatarify Python

Photorealistic avatars for video-conferencing.

Avatarify Python requires manually downloading and installing some dependencies, and is therefore best suited for users who have some experience with command line applications. [Avatarify Desktop](https://github.com/alievk/avatarify-desktop), which aims to be easier to install and use, is recommended for most users. If you still want to use Avatarify Python, proceed to the [install instructions](docs/).

Based on [First Order Motion Model](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model).

**Avatarify Python is not affiliated with Avatarify Inc.**
