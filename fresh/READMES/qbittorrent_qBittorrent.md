### Description:
qBittorrent is a bittorrent client programmed in C++ / Qt that uses
libtorrent (sometimes called libtorrent-rasterbar) by Arvid Norberg.

It aims to be a good alternative to all other bittorrent clients
out there. qBittorrent is fast, stable and provides unicode
support as well as many features.
