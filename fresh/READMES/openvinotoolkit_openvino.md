This toolkit allows developers to deploy pre-trained deep learning models
through a high-level C++ Inference Engine API integrated with application logic.

This open source version includes several components: namely [Model Optimizer], [nGraph] and
[Inference Engine], as well as CPU, GPU, MYRIAD, multi device and heterogeneous plugins to accelerate deep learning inferencing on Intel® CPUs and Intel® Processor Graphics.
It supports pre-trained models from the [Open Model Zoo], along with 100+ open
source and public models in popular formats such as Caffe\*, TensorFlow\*,
MXNet\* and ONNX\*.

## Repository components:
* [Inference Engine]
* [nGraph]
* [Model Optimizer]
