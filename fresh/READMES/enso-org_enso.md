# [Enso.org](https://enso.org). Get insights you can rely on. In real time.

Enso is an award-winning interactive programming language with dual visual and
textual representations. It is a tool that spans the entire stack, going from
high-level visualisation and communication to the nitty-gritty of backend
services, all in a single language. Watch the following introduction video to
learn what Enso is, and how it helps companies build data workflows in minutes
instead of weeks.

# Enso's Features

Turning your data into knowledge is slow and error-prone. You can’t trust tools
that don’t embrace best practices and provide quality assurance. Enso redefines
the way you can work with your data: it is interactive, provides intelligent
assistance, and was designed on a strong mathematical foundation, so you can
always trust the results you get.

<ul><ul>
    <b>Intelligent suggestions of possible next steps. Build workflows in minutes instead of weeks.</b><br/>
    Enso analyses the data, suggests possible next steps, and displays related
    help and examples. It lets you build dashboards, RPA workflows, and apps,
    with no coding required. Enso ships with a robust set of libraries, allowing
    you to work with local files, databases, HTTP services and other
    applications in a seamless fashion.

    <b>A powerful, purely functional language. Both visual and textual.</b><br/>
    Enso incorporates many recent innovations in data processing and programming
    language design to allow you to work interactively and trust the results
    that you get. It is a purely functional programming language with
    higher-order functions, user-defined algebraic datatypes, pattern-matching,
    and two equivalent representations that you can switch between on-demand.

    the box, and you can easily extend it with libraries such as D3.js,
    Three.js, Babylon.js, deck.gl, VTK.js, Potree, and many more.

# Enso Source Code

Enso is a community-driven open source project which is, and will always be,
open and free to use. Join us, help us to build it, and spread the word!

<br/>

### Project Components

Enso consists of several sub projects:

- **Enso Engine:** The Enso Engine is the set of tools that implement the Enso
  language and its associated services. These include the Enso interpreter, a
  just-in-time compiler and runtime (both powered by
  [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org)), and a language server that lets you
  inspect Enso code as it runs. These components can be used on their own as
  command line tools.

- **Enso IDE:** The [Enso IDE](https://github.com/enso-org/ide) is the desktop
  application that allows working with the visual form of Enso. It consists of
  an Electron application, a high performance WebGL UI framework, and the
  searcher which provides contextual search, hints, and documentation for all of
  Enso's functionality.

<br/>

### License

The Enso Engine is licensed under the
[Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/apache-2.0), as specified in the
[LICENSE](https://github.com/enso-org/enso/blob/main/LICENSE) file. The Enso IDE
is licensed under the [AGPL 3.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0), as
specified in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/enso-org/ide/blob/main/LICENSE)
file.

This license set was choosen to both provide you with a complete freedom to use
Enso, create libraries, and release them under any license of your choice, while
also allowing us to release commercial products on top of the platform,
including Enso Cloud and Enso Enterprise server managers.

<br/>

### Contributing to Enso

Enso is a community-driven open source project which is and will always be open
and free to use. We are committed to a fully transparent development process and
highly appreciate every contribution. If you love the vision behind Enso and you
want to redefine the data processing world, join us and help us track down bugs,
implement new features, improve the documentation or spread the word!

If you'd like to help us make this vision a reality, please feel free to join
our [chat](https://discord.gg/enso), and take a look at our
[development and contribution guidelines](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). The latter
describes all the ways in which you can help out with the project, as well as
provides detailed instructions for building and hacking on Enso.

If you believe that you have found a security vulnerability in Enso, or that you
have a bug report that poses a security risk to Enso's users, please take a look
at our [security guidelines](./docs/SECURITY.md) for a course of action.

<br/>

### Enso's Design

If you would like to gain a better understanding of the principles on which Enso
is based, or just delve into the why's and what's of Enso's design, please take
a look in the [`docs/` folder](./docs/). It is split up into subfolders for each
component of Enso. You can view this same documentation in a rendered form at
[the developer docs website](https://enso.org/docs/developer).

This folder also contains a document on Enso's
[design philosophy](./docs/enso-philosophy.md), that details the thought process
that we use when contemplating changes or additions to the language.

This documentation will evolve as Enso does, both to help newcomers to the
project understand the reasoning behind the code, but also to act as a record of
the decisions that have been made through Enso's evolution.
