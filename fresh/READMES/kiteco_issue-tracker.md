# Kite Issue Tracker

This repository is used to track user-reported issues for the [Kite](https://kite.com) product. Kite's product consists
of:

* __Kite Engine:__ The local application which analyzes code and hosts the machine learning models that power the Kite
experience.
* __Editor plugins:__ Kite provides integrations with a variety of editors. These plugins talk to the Kite Engine based
on user interactions within the editor.
* __Kite Copilot:__ Companion documentation tool that can show you docs for the Python object underneath your editor's
cursor.

If you're a new user, you can [__download Kite here__](https://kite.com/download).

* üêõ A bug report
