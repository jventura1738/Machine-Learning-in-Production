> :warning: In the future, [the `senna` npm package](https://npmjs.com/package/senna) will be deprecated and this repo archived (ie. switched to read-only mode). Development continues in [the `liferay/liferay-portal` repo](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal) (more specifically, inside [the `frontend-js-spa-web` module](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/tree/master/modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-spa-web)), but not as an independent project, in order to better integrate with and serve the needs of Liferay DXP. At the time of writing, the last official release was [v2.7.9](https://github.com/liferay/senna.js/tree/v2.7.9), from the `2.x` series on the `master` branch, and it is still used by a number of pre-EOL versions of Liferay DXP, such as [7.0.x](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/6b14c8e0496926309a5fac347cb2d342d7412c1f/modules/apps/foundation/frontend-js/frontend-js-spa-web/package.json#L6), [7.1.x](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/d9a4b24bf1871d509c2bb12e38669bb8552db1a5/modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-spa-web/package.json#L17), [7.2.x](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/ded0e9390637985231e962e4ad4cfa4639eabb26/modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-spa-web/package.json#L6), and [7.3.x](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal/blob/c940e8fd455d59fe05fd2038410070412411947c/modules/apps/frontend-js/frontend-js-spa-web/package.json#L6). Any maintenance releases required to the v2.x series of the npm package in the future will be made from [the liferay-frontend-projects monorepo](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/tree/master/maintenance/projects/senna).

## Support and Project status

Senna.js is widely used and well maintained internally at Liferay but
does not currently have staffing to support the open source release.  As such
this project is mostly _internal_ and support is _minimal_.  For certain
issues, like build integration we are in an especially bad position to offer
support.

To get assistance you can use any of the following forums

1. Look through the [documentation](https://sennajs.com).
2. File an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/liferay/senna.js/issues)

We will try our best, but keep in mind that given our support staffing, we may
not be able to help.
