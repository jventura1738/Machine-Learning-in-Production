### STEALING UR FEELINGS

[https://stealingurfeelin.gs](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) :arrow_left: :arrow_left: :arrow_left: 

Meet the new AI that knows you better than you know yourself.

[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) is an augmented reality experience that reveals how your favorite apps can use facial emotion recognition technology to make decisions about your life, promote inequalities, and even destabilize American democracy. Using the AI techniques described in corporate patents, [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) learns your deepest secrets just by analyzing your face.

It [won the 2020 Webby Award](https://winners.webbyawards.com/#/2020/video/immersive-and-mixed-reality/documentary/126432/stealing-ur-feelings) for Best Immersive Documentary.

The project [premiered on the internet](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/23/introducing-stealing-ur-feelings-an-interactive-documentary-about-big-tech-ai-and-you/) on September 23, 2019. 

It world premiered at the [2019 Tribeca Film Festival](https://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/archive/stealing-ur-feelings-2019) and was exhibited at the [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/tate-exchange/workshop/higher-resolution). It was profiled by the [Museum of the Moving Image](http://www.scienceandfilm.org/articles/3216/stealing-ur-feelings), [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-video-watches-you-back/), [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/02/stealing-ur-feelings-ar-film-facial-recognition-tribeca-2019-kanye-pizza/), [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stealing-ur-feelings-1.5362954), and many more; [MIT selected it for inclusion in DocuBase](https://docubase.mit.edu/project/stealing-ur-feelings/), a curated database of people and projects transforming documentary in the digital age.

[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) is supported by a $50,000 prize from the NetGain partnership -- a collaboration between Mozilla, MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, Knight Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations. 

The project was somewhat notoriously plagiarized by the Financial Times; this event was chronicled in an [article for The American Prospect](https://prospect.org/culture/stealing-ur-website-emotion-recognition-ai-financial-times/).

[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) began life as an application for Mozilla's 2018 [awards for art and advocacy exploring artificial intelligence](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/06/04/mozilla-announces-225000-for-art-and-advocacy-exploring-artificial-intelligence/). **This repository is an open workspace.** Check back often for updates!
