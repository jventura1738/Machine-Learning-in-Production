# Step-by-Step Instructions

## Supplies Not Included

1. Brayer — a kind of roller you would use for a lino plate.
2. Ink — any kind of ink, the kind you would use for block printing.

## Zine Machine Basic Setup
1. Print out the parts for the zine machine. You'll need access to a 3D printer, of course. Or, if you want you can send the stl files to a 3rd party for printing.
   1. Note that you will need to slice these stl files first before you bring them to a 3d printer. We recommend using [slic3r](https://slic3r.org/). You can find instructions on how to do this on their website.
2. Follow the assembly instructions found [here](Instructions/zine-machine-assembly.pdf).
3. (optional) Clamp the zine machine down for a day or two before use the plastic tends to bend very slightly.

## Zine Machine Custom Image Plates
Many 3D software prorams allow you to drop in a 2d vector and "pull" it into the third dimension. If you can imagine you have a black and white image. All the white pixels are "0mm" height and all the black pixels are "3mm" height. That's effectively how it works.

You can find the instructions [here](Instructions/creating-plates.pdf).

# FAQ

This FAQ will expand as we encounter more questions. Feel free to make a pull request to add some yourself.

## Printing the Zine Machine

#### Q: Can I just buy a zine machine from you?
At the moment, we don't have the ability to provide this service.

#### Q: What 3D printer do you recommend?
We used a Prusa MK3S+ — the settings were calibrated for this printer and will work the best.

## Creating Custom Plates

#### Q: What kind of images can I use?

Look at woodcuts or linocuts for some inspiration. Be careful when trying to print an image with very thin lines or lots of complex intersections. If you hope to push the limits of your design, you'll want to know the thickness of the nozzle on your 3D printer.

#### Q: I don't have adobe illustrator!

You can find many "vectorizers" online. We've used [rapid resizer](https://online.rapidresizer.com/tracer.php) before.
