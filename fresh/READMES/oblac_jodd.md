## üëã Hello!

Welcome to the **Jodd** - a unique, alternative world of Java :) You can find here some micro-frameworks and some handy tools. Nothing more, nothing less.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è THIS IS THE OLD REPO. USE NEW JODD REPOS FOR v6+ ‚ÄºÔ∏è

**Jodd v6** is the maintained version, working on Java 8 and 11. The following components are promoted to version 6:

+ [jodd-util](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-util) ‚≠ê
+ [jodd-mail](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-mail) ‚≠ê
+ [jodd-json](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-json) ‚≠ê
+ [jodd-lagarto](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-lagarto) ‚≠ê
+ [jodd-http](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-http) ‚≠ê
+ [jodd-props](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-props) ‚≠ê
+ [jodd-petite](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-petite) ‚≠ê
+ [jodd-proxetta](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-proxetta) ‚≠ê
+ [jodd-db](https://github.com/oblac/jodd-db) ‚≠ê

The decision which component is promoted is based on the Maven Central Repo statistics. 

Version **v5** contains remaining libraries and frameworks. They are in maintenance mode.

Sorry, I can only do so much.
