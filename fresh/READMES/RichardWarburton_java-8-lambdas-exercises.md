java-8-lambdas-exercises
========================

This git repository contains support material for the [Java 8 Lambdas](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/java-8-lambdas/9781449370831/) book.

Project Structure
-----------------

The overall code layout is:

* Code is in `src/main/java`
* Tests are in `src/test/java`

Within these directories things are organised by package:

* Exercises which involve code in `com.insightfullogic.java8.exercises`
* Answers are in `com.insightfullogic.java8.answers` Coding questions are all in the form of failing tests, and the package-info.java
contains the correct answer to questions which don't involve writing code, such as yes/no questions. For example here are the chapter 2 answers:
https://github.com/RichardWarburton/java-8-lambdas-exercises/blob/master/src/main/java/com/insightfullogic/java8/answers/chapter2/package-info.java
* Code Examples/Listings are in `com.insightfullogic.java8.examples`

The sub-packages then correspond to the chapter number, so the examples for chapter 4 are in
 `com.insightfullogic.java8.examples.chapter4`.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you find any issues with the exercises or examples then please submit them via the
[O'Reilly Errata Page](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920030713).
