## What is NeoMutt?

* NeoMutt is a project of projects.
* A place to gather all the patches against Mutt.
* A place for all the developers to gather.

Hopefully this will build the community and reduce duplicated effort.

NeoMutt was created when Richard Russon (@FlatCap) took all the old Mutt patches,
sorted through them, fixed them up and documented them.
