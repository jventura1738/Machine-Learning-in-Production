## Overview
King Phisher is a tool for testing and promoting user awareness by simulating
real world phishing attacks. It features an easy to use, yet very flexible
architecture allowing full control over both emails and server content.
King Phisher can be used to run campaigns ranging from simple awareness
training to more complicated scenarios in which user aware content is served
for harvesting credentials.

King Phisher is only to be used for legal applications when the explicit
permission of the targeted organization has been obtained.

Get the latest stable version from the
[GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/securestate/king-phisher/releases) or
use git to checkout the project from source.

## Feature Overview
 * Run multiple phishing campaigns simultaneously
 * Send email with embedded images for a more legitimate appearance
 * Optional Two-Factor authentication
 * Credential harvesting from landing pages
 * SMS alerts regarding campaign status
 * Web page cloning capabilities
 * Integrated Sender Policy Framework (SPF) checks

## Plugins
Both the client and server can be extended with functionality provided by
plugins. A small number of plugins are packaged with King Phisher and
additional ones are available in the [Plugins repository](https://github.com/securestate/king-phisher-plugins).

## Template Files
Template files for both messages and server pages can be found in the separate
King Phisher [Templates repository](https://github.com/securestate/king-phisher-templates).
Any contributions regarding templates should also be submitted via a pull
request to the templates repository.

steps to help new users get started with their first campaigns. Additional
technical documentation intended for developers is kept separate as outlined
