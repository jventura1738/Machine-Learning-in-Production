# Introduction

This is a collection of examples to help you get familiar with the Elastic Stack. Each example folder includes a README with detailed instructions for getting up and running with the  particular example. The following information pertains to the [examples](https://github.com/elastic/examples) repo as a whole.

### Contents

- [Quick start](#quick-start)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Example catalog](#example-catalog)

### Quick start

You have a few options to get started with the examples:

- If you want to try them all, you can [download the entire repo ](https://github.com/elastic/examples/archive/master.zip). Or, if you are familiar with Git, you can [clone the repo](https://github.com/elastic/examples.git). Then, simply follow the instructions in the individual README of the examples you're interested in to get started.

- If you are only interested in a specific example or two, you can download the contents of just those examples - follow instructions in the individual READMEs OR you can use some of the [options mentioned here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repo).

### Contributing
