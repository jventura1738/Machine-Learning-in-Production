##	Introduction 

***The exercise text contents of this repository was collected from GitHub account of [zhiwehu](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises). I collected it to practice and solve all the listed problems with python. Even after these collected problems are all set up, I will try to add more problems in near future. If you are a very beginner with python then I hope this 100+ exercise will help you a lot to get your hands free with python.***

***One will find the given problems very simple and easy to understand. A beginner can try 3-5 problems a day which will take a little time to solve but definitely will learn a couple of new stuff (no matter how lazy you are :P ). And after regular practice of only a month, one can find himself solved more than 100++ problems which are obviously not a deniable achievement.***

***In this repository, I will be gradually updating the codebase of the given problems with my own solutions. Also, I may try to explain the code and tell my opinion about the problem if needed. Main Authors solutions are in python 2 & my solutions will be in python 3. Every problem is divided into a template format which is discussed below. There is a [discussion](https://github.com/darkprinx/100-plus-Python-programming-exercises-extended/issues/3) section so don't forget to share your opinion, ideas and feel free to discuss anything wrong or mistake***

***A Big Thanks to [apurvmishra99](https://github.com/apurvmishra99) for contributing the repository by cleaning up the formatting of all Days_.md files. fixing some random errors, fixing some variable naming with PEP8 conventions, and adding a whole new folder of [jupyter](https://github.com/darkprinx/100-plus-Python-programming-exercises-extended/tree/master/notebooks) notebook of all 24 days.***
