## About

uMap lets you create maps with OpenStreetMap layers in a minute and embed them in your site.
*Because we think that the more OSM will be used, the more OSM will be improved.*
It uses [django-leaflet-storage](https://github.com/umap-project/django-leaflet-storage) and [Leaflet.Storage](https://github.com/umap-project/Leaflet.Storage),  built on top of Django and Leaflet.


## Installation and configuration

See [developer documentation](https://umap-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/).
