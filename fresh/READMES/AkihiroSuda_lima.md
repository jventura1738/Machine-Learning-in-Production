# Lima: Linux virtual machines (on macOS, in most cases)

Lima launches Linux virtual machines with automatic file sharing, port forwarding, and [containerd](https://containerd.io).

Lima can be considered as a some sort of unofficial "macOS subsystem for Linux", or "containerd for Mac".

Lima is expected to be used on macOS hosts, but can be used on Linux hosts as well.

✅ Automatic file sharing

✅ Automatic port forwarding

✅ Built-in support for [containerd](https://containerd.io)

✅ Intel on Intel

✅ ARM on Intel

✅ ARM on ARM

✅ Intel on ARM

✅ Various guest Linux distributions: [Ubuntu](./examples/ubuntu.yaml), [Debian](./examples/debian.yaml), [Fedora](./examples/fedora.yaml), [Alpine](./examples/alpine.yaml), [Arch Linux](./examples/archlinux.yaml), [openSUSE](./examples/opensuse.yaml)...

Related project: [sshocker (ssh with file sharing and port forwarding)](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/sshocker)

This project is unrelated to [The Lima driver project (driver for ARM Mali GPUs)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/lima).

## Motivation

The goal of Lima is to promote [containerd](https://containerd.io) including [nerdctl (contaiNERD ctl)](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl)
to Mac users, but Lima can be used for non-container applications as well.

## Examples

### uname
```console
$ uname -a
Darwin macbook.local 20.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.4.0: Thu Apr 22 21:46:47 PDT 2021; root:xnu-7195.101.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64

$ lima uname -a
Linux lima-default 5.11.0-16-generic #17-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 14 20:12:43 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

$ LIMA_INSTANCE=arm lima uname -a
Linux lima-arm 5.11.0-16-generic #17-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 14 20:10:16 UTC 2021 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
```

### Sharing files across macOS and Linux
```console
$ echo "files under /Users on macOS filesystem are readable from Linux" > some-file

$ lima cat some-file
files under /Users on macOS filesystem are readable from Linux

$ lima sh -c 'echo "/tmp/lima is writable from both macOS and Linux" > /tmp/lima/another-file'

$ cat /tmp/lima/another-file
/tmp/lima is writable from both macOS and Linux"
```

### Running containerd containers (compatible with Docker containers)
```console
$ lima nerdctl run -d --name nginx -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 nginx:alpine
```

http://127.0.0.1:8080 is accessible from both macOS and Linux.

> **NOTE**
> Privileged ports (1-1023) cannot be forwarded

For the usage of containerd and nerdctl (contaiNERD ctl), visit https://github.com/containerd/containerd and https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl.

## Getting started
### Installation

[Homebrew package](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/lima.rb) is available for Intel Mac.

```console
$ brew install lima
```

<details>
<summary>Manual installation steps (required for ARM Mac)</summary>
<p>

- Install recent version of QEMU. v6.0.0 or later is recommended.

- On ARM hosts, QEMU has to be patched for enabling `--accel=hvf` support. See https://gist.github.com/nrjdalal/e70249bb5d2e9d844cc203fd11f74c55

- Download the binary archive of Lima from https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/lima/releases ,
and extract it under `/usr/local` (or somewhere else).

- To install Lima from the source, run `make && make install`.

> **NOTE**
> Lima is not regularly tested on ARM Mac.

</p>
</details>

### Usage

```console
[macOS]$ limactl start
...
INFO[0029] READY. Run `lima` to open the shell.

[macOS]$ lima uname
Linux
```

Detailed usage:

- Run `limactl start <INSTANCE>` to start the Linux instance.
  The default instance name is "default".
  Lima automatically opens an editor (`vi`) for reviewing and modifying the configuration.
  Wait until "READY" to be printed on the host terminal.

- Run `limactl shell <INSTANCE> <COMMAND>` to launch `<COMMAND>` on Linux.
  For the "default" instance, this command can be shortened as `lima <COMMAND>`.
  The `lima` command also accepts the instance name as the environment variable `$LIMA_INSTANCE`.

- Run `limactl copy <SOURCE> ... <TARGET>` to copy files between instances, or between instances and the host. Use `<INSTANCE>:<FILENAME>` to specify a source or target inside an instance.

- Run `limactl list [--json]` to show the instances.

- Run `limactl stop [--force] <INSTANCE>` to stop the instance.

- Run `limactl delete [--force] <INSTANCE>` to delete the instance.

- To enable bash completion, add `source <(limactl completion bash)` to `~/.bash_profile`.

### :warning: CAUTION: make sure to back up your data
Lima may have bugs that result in loss of data.

**Make sure to back up your data before running Lima.**

Especially, the following data might be easily lost:
- Data in the shared writable directories (`/tmp/lima` by default),
  probably after hibernation of the host machine (e.g., after closing and reopening the laptop lid)
- Data in the VM image, mostly when upgrading the version of lima

### Configuration

See [`./pkg/limayaml/default.yaml`](./pkg/limayaml/default.yaml).

The current default spec:
- OS: Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute Hippo)
- CPU (x86\_64): Haswell v4, 4 cores
- CPU (aarch64): Cortex A72, 4 cores
- Memory: 4 GiB
- Disk: 100 GiB
- Mounts: `~` (read-only), `/tmp/lima` (writable)
- SSH: 127.0.0.1:60022

## How it works

- Hypervisor: QEMU with HVF accelerator
- Filesystem sharing: [reverse sshfs](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/sshocker/blob/v0.1.0/pkg/reversesshfs/reversesshfs.go) (planned to be replaced with 9p soon)
- Port forwarding: `ssh -L`, automated by watching `/proc/net/tcp` in the guest

### Generic
#### "What's my login password?"
Password is disabled and locked by default.
You have to use `limactl shell bash` (or `lima bash`) to open a shell.

Alternatively, you may also directly ssh into the guest: `ssh -p 60022 -i ~/.lima/_config/user -o NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes 127.0.0.1`.

#### "Does Lima work on ARM Mac?"
Yes, it should work, but not regularly tested on ARM.

#### "Can I run non-Ubuntu guests?"
Debian, Fedora, Alpine, Arch Linux, and openSUSE are also known to work.
See [`./examples/`](./examples/).

An image has to satisfy the following requirements:
- systemd or OpenRC
- cloud-init
- The following binaries to be preinstalled:
  - `sudo`
- The following binaries to be preinstalled, or installable via the package manager:
  - `sshfs`
  - `newuidmap` and `newgidmap`
- `apt-get`, `dnf`, `apk`, `pacman`, or `zypper` (if you want to contribute support for another package manager, run `git grep apt-get` to find out where to modify)

#### "Can I run other container engines such as Podman?"
Yes, if you install it.

containerd can be stopped with `systemctl --user disable --now containerd`.

#### "Can I run Lima with a remote Linux machine?"
Lima itself does not support connecting to a remote Linux machine, but [sshocker](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/sshocker),
the predecessor or Lima, provides similar features for remote Linux machines.

e.g., run `sshocker -v /Users/foo:/home/foo/mnt -p 8080:80 <USER>@<HOST>` to expose `/Users/foo` to the remote machine as `/home/foo/mnt`,
and forward `localhost:8080` to the port 80 of the remote machine.

#### "Advantages compared to Docker for Mac?"
Lima is free software (Apache License 2.0), while Docker for Mac is not.
Their [EULA](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-software-end-user-license-agreement) even prohibits disclosure of benchmarking result.

On the other hand, [Moby](https://github.com/moby/moby), aka Docker for Linux, is free software, but Moby/Docker lacks several novel features of containerd, such as:
- [On-demand image pulling (aka lazy-pulling, eStargz)](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/blob/master/docs/stargz.md)
- [Running an encrypted container](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/blob/master/docs/ocicrypt.md)
- Importing and exporting [local OCI archives](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/image-layout.md)

### QEMU
#### "QEMU crashes with `HV_ERROR`"
If you have installed QEMU v6.0.0 or later on macOS 11 via homebrew, your QEMU binary should have been already automatically signed to enable HVF acceleration.

However, if you see `HV_ERROR`, you might need to sign the binary manually.

```bash
cat >entitlements.xml <<EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.hypervisor</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

codesign -s - --entitlements entitlements.xml --force /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64
```

Note: **Only** on macOS versions **before** 10.15.7 you might need to add this entitlement in addition:

```
    <key>com.apple.vm.hypervisor</key>
    <true/>
```

#### "QEMU is slow"
- Make sure that HVF is enabled with `com.apple.security.hypervisor` entitlement. See ["QEMU crashes with `HV_ERROR`"](#qemu-crashes-with-hv_error).
- Emulating non-native machines (ARM-on-Intel, Intel-on-ARM) is slow by design.

#### error "killed -9"
- make sure qemu is codesigned, See ["QEMU crashes with `HV_ERROR`"](#qemu-crashes-with-hv_error).
- if you are on macOS 10.15.7 or 11.0 or later make sure the entitlement `com.apple.vm.hypervisor` is **not** added. It only works on older macOS versions. You can clear the codesigning with `codesign --remove-signature /usr/local/bin/qemu-system-x86_64` and [start over](#getting-started).


### SSH
#### "Port forwarding does not work"
Privileged ports (1-1023) cannot be forwarded. e.g., you have to use 8080, not 80.

#### stuck on "Waiting for the essential requirement 1 of X: "ssh"

libslirp v4.6.0 used by QEMU is known to be [broken](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp/-/issues/48).
If you have libslirp v4.6.0 in `/usr/local/Cellar/libslirp`, you have to upgrade it to v4.6.1 or later (`brew upgrade`).

#### "permission denied" for `limactl cp` command

The `copy` command only works for instances that have been created by lima 0.5.0 or later. You can manually install the required identity on older instances with (replace `INSTANCE` with actual instance name):

```console
< ~/.lima/_config/user.pub limactl shell INSTANCE sh -c 'tee -a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

### "Hints for debugging other problems?"
- Inspect logs:
  - `limactl --debug start`
  - `$HOME/.lima/<INSTANCE>/serial.log`
  - `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log` (inside the guest)
  - `/var/log/cloud-init.log` (inside the guest)
- Make sure that you aren't mixing up tabs and spaces in the YAML.
- If you have passphrases for any private key under `~/.ssh`, you will need to have `ssh-agent` running.
