# README

Some material has been moved to the [USACO Guide](https://usaco-guide.vercel.app/).

## Notes

I am currently not updating the following pages:

 * README's for most implementations
 * tables and solutions for non-platinum USACO contests

Since I frequently move stuff around, some text may refer to files which no longer exist. If you would like to contribute, provide feedback, or encourage me to update something, please email me at *bqi343@gmail.com* or submit a pull request. If you have a question, please read the entirety of "Resources" -> "Questions.md" first.
