## Get Started

The quickest way to run these on a fresh Linux or Mac machine is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview):
```
curl -LO https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-4.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Then install PyTorch:

```
conda install pytorch -c soumith
```

Then clone this repo and start Jupyter Notebook:

```
git clone http://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch
cd practical-pytorch
jupyter notebook
```
