# DDDSample
This is the new home of the original DDD Sample app hosted at SourceForge. 

Our intention is to move everything from SourceForge to GitHub in due time while starting upgrading both the technical aspects as well as the DDD aspects of the DDD Sample.

The application uses Spring Boot. To start it go to the root directory and type `mvn spring-boot:run` or run the `main` method of the `Application` class from your IDE.  
Then open http://localhost:8080/dddsample in your browser (and make sure, that no firewall is blocking the communication).
