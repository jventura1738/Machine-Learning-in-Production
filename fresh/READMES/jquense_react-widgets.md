### Local development and contributing

React widgets, uses a "monorepo" organization style for managing multiple npm packages
in a single git repo. This is done through a [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) feature called
workspaces. To get everything setup and dependencies installed:

- make sure you have the **latest** version of yarn installed
- run `yarn run bootstrap` in the repo root directory

#### Running the doc site locally

- Follow the steps above
- switch to the `www` directory and run `yarn`
- `yarn start` to start the site
