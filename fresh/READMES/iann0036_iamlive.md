## Installation

### Pre-built binaries

Pre-built binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux are available for download in the project [releases](https://github.com/iann0036/iamlive/releases).

Once downloaded, place the extracted binary in your $PATH (or execute in-place). For macOS users, you may need to allow the application to run via System Preferences.

### Build with Go

To build and install this application, clone this repository and execute the following from it's base:

```
go install
```

You must have Go 1.16 or later installed for the build to work.

### Homebrew

You may also install this application using a Homebrew tap with the following command:

```
brew install iann0036/iamlive/iamlive
```

### Other Methods

* [Lambda Extension](https://github.com/iann0036/iamlive-lambda-extension)
* [Docker](https://meirg.co.il/2021/04/23/determining-aws-iam-policies-according-to-terraform-and-aws-cli/)

## Usage

To start the listener, simply run `iamlive` in a separate window to your CLI / SDK application. You can use Ctrl+C to exit when you are done.

### CLI Arguments

You can optionally also include the following arguments to the `iamlive` command:

**--set-ini:** when set, the `.aws/config` file will be updated to use the CSM monitoring or CA bundle and removed when exiting (_default: false_)

**--profile:** use the specified profile when combined with `--set-ini` (_default: default_)

**--fails-only:** when set, only failed AWS calls will be added to the policy, csm mode only (_default: false_)

**--output-file:** specify a file that will be written to on SIGHUP or exit (_default: unset_)

**--refresh-rate:** instead of flushing to console every API call, do it this number of seconds (_default: 0_)

**--sort-alphabetical:** sort actions alphabetically (_default: false_)

**--host:** host to listen on for CSM (_default: 127.0.0.1_)

**--background:** when set, the process will return the current PID and run in the background without output (_default: false_)

**--force-wildcard-resource:** when set, the Resource will always be a wildcard (_default: false_)

**--mode:** the listening mode (`csm`,`proxy`) (_default: csm_)

**--bind-addr:** the bind address for proxy mode (_default: 127.0.0.1:10080_)

**--ca-bundle:** the CA certificate bundle (PEM) to use for proxy mode (_default: ~/.iamlive/ca.pem_)

**--ca-key:** the CA certificate key to use for proxy mode (_default: ~/.iamlive/ca.key_)

**--account-id:** the AWS account ID to use in policy outputs within proxy mode (_default: 123456789012 unless detected_)

_Basic Example (CSM Mode)_

```
iamlive --set-ini
```

_Basic Example (Proxy Mode)_

```
iamlive --set-ini --mode proxy
```

_Comprehensive Example (CSM Mode)_

```
iamlive --set-ini --profile myprofile --fails-only --output-file policy.json --refresh-rate 1 --sort-alphabetical --host 127.0.0.1 --background
```

_Comprehensive Example (Proxy Mode)_

```
iamlive --set-ini --mode proxy --profile myprofile --output-file policy.json --refresh-rate 1 --sort-alphabetical --bind-addr 127.0.0.1:10080 --ca-bundle ~/.iamlive/ca.pem --ca-key ~/.iamlive/ca.key --account-id 123456789012 --background --force-wildcard-resource
```

The arguments may also be specified in an INI file located at `~/.iamlive/config`.

### CSM Mode

Client-side monitoring mode is the default behaviour and will use [metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/metrics.html) delivered locally via UDP to capture policy statements with the `Action` key only (`Resource` is only available in proxy mode).

#### CLI

To enable CSM in the AWS CLI, you should either use the `--set-ini` option or add the following to the relevant profile in `.aws/config`:

```
csm_enabled = true
```

Alternatively, you can run the following in the window executing your CLI commands:

```
export AWS_CSM_ENABLED=true
```

#### SDKs

To enable CSM in the various AWS SDKs, you can run the following in the window executing your application prior to it starting:

```
export AWS_CSM_ENABLED=true
export AWS_CSM_PORT=31000
export AWS_CSM_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

### Proxy Mode

Proxy mode will serve a local HTTP(S) server (by default at `http://127.0.0.1:10080`) that will inspect requests sent to the AWS endpoints before forwarding on to generate IAM policy statements with both `Action` and `Resource` keys. The CA key/certificate pair will be automatically generated and stored within `~/.iamlive/` by default.

#### CLI

To set the appropriate CA bundle in the AWS CLI, you should either use the `--set-ini` option or add the following to the relevant profile in `.aws/config`:

```
ca_bundle = ~/.iamlive/ca.pem
```

Alternatively, you can run the following in the window executing your CLI commands:

```
export AWS_CA_BUNDLE=~/.iamlive/ca.pem
```

You must also set the proxy settings for your session by running the following in the window executing your CLI commands:

```
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:10080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:10080
```

#### SDKs

To enable CSM in the various AWS SDKs, you can run the following in the window executing your application prior to it starting:

```
export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:10080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:10080
export AWS_CA_BUNDLE=~/.iamlive/ca.pem
```

Check the [official docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/setting-global-ca_bundle.html) for further details on setting the CA bundle.

## FAQs

_I get a message "package embed is not in GOROOT" when attempting to build myself_

This project requires Go 1.16 or above to be built correctly (due to embedding feature).
