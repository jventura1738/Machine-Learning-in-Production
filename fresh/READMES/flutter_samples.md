# Flutter samples

[![Build Status](https://github.com/flutter/samples/workflows/Master%20Branch%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flutter/samples/actions?workflow=Master%20Branch%20CI)

A collection of open source samples that illustrate best practices for
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev).

## Visual samples index

The easiest way to browse through the samples in this repo (as well as a few others!)
is the [visual samples index](https://flutter.github.io/samples).

## Tip: minimize download size

As this repository is quite big, you can use svn to download a single example.
For example:

```
svn co https://github.com/flutter/samples/trunk/provider_shopper
```

You can also use a shallow clone to download just the latest revision:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/flutter/samples.git
```
