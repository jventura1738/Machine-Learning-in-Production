## Installation (Linux):

Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (optionally, install [atomicparsley](https://github.com/wez/atomicparsley), it's required for embedding thumbnails into m4a files).

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/TheFrenchGhosty/TheFrenchGhostys-YouTube-DL-Archivist-Scripts/releases) and follow the included ReadMe, do not use the `master` branch unless you are ready to re-download EVERYTHING.

---

## Installation (Windows):

Because Windows has a path length limit of 260 characters, and because of the work required (and the fact that the Windows version was untested when it existed), Windows users needs to use the scripts in WSL (or something linux-on-windows). WSL is the only thing that bypass the path length limit so every video will get downloaded with it. However when playing those videos with a native Windows software the path length limit might be an issue, I can't do anything about that.

Installation using WSL (recommended): TODO


Installation using Cygwin, Git Bash or similar: [Here](docs/Cygwin-Git-Bash.md)

---

## Usage: 

Create a folder where you want your videos downloaded in a drive where you have enough space available.

Put the folders `Archivist Scripts`, `Audio-Only Scripts` and `Watch Scripts` in the created folder (See the documentation to understand the differences).

Add content to a 'Source - XXXXXX.txt' file depending of what type of content you want to download (See the documentation to understand the differences).

Open a terminal in the folder of the script you want to use and run `./[SCRIPT].sh`.

Done.
