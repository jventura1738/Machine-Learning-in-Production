### [What's new with Bot Framework?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/what-is-new?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

Bot Framework provides the most comprehensive experience for building conversation applications.

With the [Bot Framework SDK](#bot-framework-sdk-v4), developers can build bots that converse free-form or with guided interactions including using simple text or rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons.

Developers can model and build sophisticated conversation using their favorite programming languages including C#, JS, Python and Java or using [Bot Framework Composer](https://aka.ms/bfcomposer), an open-source, visual authoring canvas for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to design and build conversational experiences with Language Understanding, QnA Maker and sophisticated composition of bot replies (Language Generation).

Checkout theâ€¯[Bot Framework ecosystem](#bot-framework-ecosystem) section to learn more about other tooling and services related to the Bot Framework SDK.

## Channels and Adapters
There are two ways to connect your bot to a client experience:
* **Azure Bot Service Channel** - Language and SDK independent support via Azure Bot Service
* **Bot Framework SDK Adapter** -  A per language Adapter component

### Bot Framework Composer
[Bot Framework Composer](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Composer/blob/main/README.md) is an integrated development tool for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to build bots and conversational experiences with the Microsoft Bot Framework. Within this tool, you'll find everything you need to build a sophisticated conversational experience.

### Botkit
[Botkit][100] is a developer tool and SDK for building chat bots, apps and custom integrations for major messaging platforms. Botkit bots `hear()` triggers, `ask()` questions and `say()` replies. Developers can use this syntax to build dialogs - now cross compatible with the latest version of Bot Framework SDK.

In addition, Botkit brings with it 6 platform adapters allowing Javascript bot applications to communicate directly with messaging platforms: [Slack][102], [Webex Teams][103], [Google Hangouts][104], [Facebook Messenger][105], [Twilio][106], and [Web chat][107].

Botkit is part of Microsoft Bot Framework and is released under the [MIT Open Source license][101]

### Bot Framework Virtual Assistant Solution Accelerator

The [Bot Framework Solutions repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-solutions#readme) is home to the [Virtual Assistant Solution Accelerator](https://aka.ms/bfvadocs), which provides a set of templates, solution accelerators and skills to help build sophisticated conversational experiences.

- [**Virtual Assistant.**](https://aka.ms/bfvadocs) Customers and partners have a significant need to deliver a conversational assistant tailored to their brand, personalized to their users, and made available across a broad range of canvases and devices. <br/><br/>  This brings together all of the supporting components and greatly simplifies the creation of a new bot project including: basic conversational intents, Dispatch integration, QnA Maker, Application Insights and an automated deployment.

- [**Skills.**](https://aka.ms/bfskillsdocs) A library of re-usable conversational skill building-blocks enabling you to add functionality to a Bot. We currently provide: Calendar, Email, Task, Point of Interest, Automotive, Weather and News skills. Skills include LUIS models, Dialogs, and integration code delivered in source code form to customize and extend as required.

- [**Analytics.**](https://github.com/Microsoft/AI/blob/main/docs/readme.md#analytics) Gain key insights into your botâ€™s health and behavior with the Bot Framework Analytics solutions, which includes: sample Application Insights queries, and Power BI dashboards to understand the full breadth of your botâ€™s conversations with users.

### Azure Bot Service
Azure Bot Service enables you to host intelligent, enterprise-grade bots with complete ownership and control of your data. Developers can register and connect their bots to users on Skype, Microsoft Teams, Cortana, Web Chat, and more. [[Docs][28]]

* **Direct Line JS Client**: If you want to use the Direct Line channel in Azure Bot Service and are not using the WebChat client, the Direct Line JS client can be used in your custom application. [[Readme][30]]

<a name="ABS-whats-new"></a>

* **Direct Line Speech Channel**: We are bringing together the Bot Framework and Microsoft's Speech Services to provide a channel that enables streamed speech and text bi-directionally from the client to the bot application.  To sign up, add the 'Direct Line Speech' channel to your Azure Bot Service.

[30]:https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-DirectLineJS/blob/main/README.md

* **Better isolation for your Bot - Direct Line App Service Extension** : The Direct Line App Service Extension can be deployed as part of a VNET, allowing IT administrators to have more control over conversation traffic and improved latency in conversations due to reduction in the number of hops. Get started with Direct Line App Service Extension here. A VNET lets you create your own private space in Azure and is crucial to your cloud network as it offers isolation, segmentation, and other key benefits.

### Bot Framework Emulator
The [Bot Framework Emulator][60] is a  cross-platform desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug bots built using the Bot Framework SDK. You can use the Bot Framework Emulator to test bots running locally on your machine or to connect to bots running remotely. [[Download latest][61] | [Docs][62]]

### Bot Framework CLI
The Bot Framework CLI Tools hosts the [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli) cross-platform Bot Framework CLI tool, designed to support building robust end-to-end development workflows. The Bot Framework CLI tool replaced the [legacy standalone tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Tools) used to manage bots and related services. BF CLI aggregates the collection of cross-platform tools into one cohesive and consistent interface.
