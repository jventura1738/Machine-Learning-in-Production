=========================================================

**openage**: a volunteer project to create a free engine clone of the *Genie Engine* used by *Age of Empires*, *Age of Empires II (HD)* and *Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds*, comparable to projects like [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/), [OpenRA](http://openra.net/),  [OpenSAGE](https://github.com/OpenSAGE/OpenSAGE/), [OpenTTD](https://openttd.org/) and [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.org/). At the moment we focus our efforts on the integration of *Age of Empires II*, while being primarily aimed at POSIX platforms such as **GNU/Linux**.

openage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics), but (for obvious reasons) doesn't ship them.
To play, you require *an original AoE II: TC or [AoE II: HD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/)* installation
(via [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) or [Steam-Linux](doc/media_convert.md#how-to-use-the-original-game-assets)).

Technical foundation
--------------------

Technology     | Component
---------------|----------
**C++17**      | Engine core
**Python3**    | Scripting, media conversion, in-game console, code generation
**Qt5**        | Graphical user interface
**Cython**     | Glue code
**CMake**      | Build system
**OpenGL3.3**  | Rendering, shaders
**SDL2**       | Cross-platform Audio/Input/Window handling
**Opus**       | Audio codec
[**nyan**](https://github.com/SFTtech/nyan) | Content Configuration and Modding
**Humans**     | Mixing together all of the above


Goals
-----

* Fully authentic look and feel
    * This can only be approximated, since the behaviour of the original game is mostly undocumented,
    and guessing/experimenting can only get you this close
    * We will not implement useless artificial limitations (max 30 selectable units...)
* An easily-moddable content format: [**nyan** yet another notation](https://github.com/SFTtech/nyan)
* An integrated Python console and API, comparable to [blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* AI scripting in Python, you can use [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
    * here is some [additional literature](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* Re-creating [free game assets](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-data)
* Multiplayer (obviously)
* Matchmaking and ranking with a [haskell masterserver](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-masterserver)
* Optionally, [improvements](/doc/ideas/) over the original game
* Awesome infrastructure such as our own [Kevin CI service](https://github.com/SFTtech/kevin)

But beware, for sanity reasons:

* No network compatibility with the original game.
  You really wanna have the same problems again?
* No binary compatibility with the original game.
  A one-way script to convert maps/savegames/missions to openage is planned though.


Current State of the Project
----------------------------

**Important notice**: Gameplay is currently non-functional as the internal simulation is replaced by a more sophisticated implementation. You also might experience errors when running a build. Gameplay will return in a later update. Detailed explanations can be found in this [blog post](https://blog.openage.dev/new-gamestate-2020.html).

* What features are currently implemented?
    * See [status page](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/projects).

* What's the plan?
    * See [doc/milestones.md](/doc/milestones.md). We also have [lists of crazy xor good ideas](/doc/ideas) and a [technical overview for requested features](/doc/ideas/fr_technical_overview.md).


Installation Packages
---------------------

**Supported Platforms:** Linux, Windows 10, MacOS X 10.14

* For **Linux** check at [repology](https://repology.org/project/openage/versions) if your distribution has any packages available or [here](https://bintray.com/simonsan/openage-packages/openage-linux-releases) for any future updates on *.deb and AppImage packages.
* For **Windows** check our [release page](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/releases) for the latest installer or [here](https://dl.bintray.com/simonsan/openage-packages/) for nightly builds.

    * **NOTE:** If you have any problems starting conversion or starting *openage* take a look into the [package instructions](doc/build_instructions/packages.md) and our [troubleshooting guide](/doc/troubleshooting.md).

    * **NOTE:** For **MacOSX** we currently don't have any packages.


Quickstart
----------------------------------

  Operating System    | Build status
  :------------------:|:--------------:
  Debian Sid          | [Todo: Kevin #11](https://github.com/SFTtech/kevin/issues/11)
  macOS               | [![macOS build status](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/workflows/macOS-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/actions?query=workflow%3AmacOS-CI)
  Windows 10 - x64    | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/66sx35key94u740e?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/simonsan/openage-sl215)


* How do I get this to run on my box?
    * See [doc/building.md](/doc/building.md).

* I compiled everything. Now how do I run it?
    * Execute `bin/run`.
    * [The convert script](/doc/media_convert.md) will transform original assets into openage formats, which are a lot saner and more moddable.
    * Use your brain and react to the things you'll see.

* Waaaaaah! It
    * segfaults
    * prints error messages I don't want to read
    * ate my dog

All of those are features, not bugs.

To turn them off, use `./run --dont-segfault --no-errors --dont-eat-dog`.


If this still does not help, try our [troubleshooting guide](/doc/troubleshooting.md), the [contact section](#contact)

Contributing
============

You might ask yourself now "Yeah, this sounds cool and all, but how do *I* participate
and ~~get famous~~ contribute useful features?".

Fortunately for you, there is a lot to do and we are very grateful for help.

## Where do I start?

* The engine has several [core parts](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/projects) that need help.
  You can look at the project related issues and find something for you, for example:
    * **Asset Converter:** Converts whatever properietary format used by a Age of Empires 2 into
    open formats. Written mostly in Python 3. There are a lot of TODOs and beginner issues available
    right now, so it's a good place to get your feet wet.
    * **Game simulation:** Also known as the gameplay implementation. Written in C++, using the
    Entity-Component-System paradigm in addition to an event-driven simulation.
    * **Documentation:** We not only document code, but also anything technical about the Genie engine
    and its games. If you like documenting [file formats](/doc/media)
    or thouroughly investigating [game mechanics](/doc/reverse_engineering),
    then this might be the right place to start.
* **Check the issues** [labelled with good first issues](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These are tasks that you can start right away
  and don't require much previous knowledge.
* **Ask us** in the [chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#sfttech:matrix.org). Someone there could need
  help with something.
* You can also **take the initiative** and fix a bug you found, create an issue for discussion or
  implement a feature that we never though of, but always wanted.


## Ok, I found something. What now?

* **[Tell us](#contact)**, if you haven't already. Chances are that we have additional information
  and directions.
* **[Read the docs](/doc)**. They will answer most "administrative"
  questions like what code style is used and how the engine core parts are connected.
* **Read the code** and get familiar with the engine component you want to work with.
* Do not hesitate to **[ask us for help](#contact)** if you do not understand something.


## How do I contribute my features/changes?

* Read the **[contributing guide](/doc/contributing.md)**.
* You can upload work in progress (WIP) revisions or drafts of your contribution to get feedback or support.
* Tell us (again) when you want us to review your work.

## I want to help, but I'm not a programmer...

Then openage might be a good reason to become one! We have many issues and tasks for beginners. You
just have to ask and we'll find something. Alternatively, lurking is also allowed.

Cheers, happy hecking.


Development Process
-------------------

What does openage development look like in practice?

* extensive [synchronization](#contact)!
* [doc/development.md](/doc/development.md).

How can I help?

* [doc/contributing.md](/doc/contributing.md).

All documentation is also in this repo:

* Code documentation is embedded in the sources for Doxygen (see [doc readme](/doc/README.md)).
* Have a look at the [doc directory](/doc/). This folder tends to get outdated when code changes.

I know that probably nobody is ever gonna look at the `copying.md` file,
but if you want to contribute code to openage, please take the time to
skim through it and add yourself to the authors list.
