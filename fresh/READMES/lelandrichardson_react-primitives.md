Primitive React Interfaces Across Targets

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-primitives)]((https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-primitives))

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save react-primitives
```

You will also need to install the targets you want to support:

- web:
  ```sh
  npm install --save react-dom react-native-web react-art
  ```
- native iOS and Android:
  ```sh
  npm install --save react-native
  ```
- sketch:
  ```sh
  npm install --save react-sketchapp react-test-renderer
  ```
- figma:
  ```sh
  npm install --save react-figma
  ```
- vr:
  ```sh
  npm install --save react-360
  ```
- Windows:
  ```sh
  npm install --save react-native-windows
  ```

### Usage

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { View, Text, Image, StyleSheet } from "react-primitives";

class Foo extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <View style={styles.foo}>{this.props.children}</View>;
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  foo: {
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
    backgroundColor: "#ff00ff"
  }
});
```

## What is this?

This library attempts to propose an ideal set of primitives around building
React applications, regardless of Platform. In the future, this could be
used as a shared interface among React and React Native components that
don't use platform-specific APIs.

Importantly, this includes `StyleSheet` for declaring styles, as well as
`Animated` for doing declarative Animations.

The exported APIs thus far are:

1. `Animated`: Pulled from the [animated](https://github.com/animatedjs/animated) project.
2. `StyleSheet`: Follows React Native's StyleSheet API.
3. `View`: A base component for Layout.
4. `Text`: A base component for Text rendering.
5. `Image`: A base component for Image rendering.
6. `Touchable`: A base component for interaction.
7. `Easing`: A base set of easing functions.
8. `Dimensions`: Get the devices dimensions.
9. `PixelRatio`: Get the devices pixel density.
10. `Platform`: Get information about the platform. (iOS, Android, Web, Sketch, VR,...)

In the future, a `TextInput` component may also be added.

## Props where props are due

This library was largely inspired from the work done by [Nicolas Gallager](https://github.com/necolas)
and his great work on the [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) library. A few of the files
in this repo are even copied directly from his project.
