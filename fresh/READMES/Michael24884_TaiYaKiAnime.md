## NOTE

Taiyaki is a FOSS (Free and Open Sourced Software) mobile app that allows the user to view their anime and have their data all in one place. It is built with Flutter and supports both Android and iOS platforms.

This app is not intended to be used as a piracy tool, but in fact as a means to make it safer for the average watcher from viruses, harmful advirts, and scams found on typical shady websites.

This app is free to use and will never cost the user any amount of money to use. As always please download the app on the Github site and not from any third party providers.

### ABOUT THE APP
