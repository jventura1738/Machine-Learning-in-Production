## Overview

Pgweb is a web-based database browser for PostgreSQL, written in Go and works
on OSX, Linux and Windows machines. Main idea behind using Go for backend development
is to utilize ability of the compiler to produce zero-dependency binaries for 
multiple platforms. Pgweb was created as an attempt to build very simple and portable
application to work with local or remote PostgreSQL databases.

pgweb
```

You can also provide connection flags:

```
pgweb --host localhost --user myuser --db mydb
```

Connection URL scheme is also supported:

```
pgweb --url postgres://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=[mode]

## Deploy on Heroku

[![Heroku Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb)

## Testing

Before running tests, make sure you have PostgreSQL server running on `localhost:5432`
interface. Also, you must have `postgres` user that could create new databases
in your local environment. Pgweb server should not be running at the same time.

Execute test suite:

```
make test
```

If you're using Docker locally, you might also run pgweb test suite against
all supported PostgreSQL version with a single command:

```
make test-all
```
