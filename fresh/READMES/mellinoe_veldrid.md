# Veldrid

Veldrid is a cross-platform, graphics API-agnostic rendering and compute library for .NET. It provides a powerful, unified interface to a system's GPU and includes more advanced features than any other .NET library. Unlike other platform- or vendor-specific technologies, Veldrid can be used to create high-performance 3D applications that are truly portable.

Supported backends:

* Direct3D 11
* Vulkan
* Metal
* OpenGL 3
* OpenGL ES 3
