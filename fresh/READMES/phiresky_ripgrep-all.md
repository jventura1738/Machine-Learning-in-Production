# rga: ripgrep, but also search in PDFs, E-Books, Office documents, zip, tar.gz, etc.

rga is a line-oriented search tool that allows you to look for a regex in a multitude of file types. rga wraps the awesome [ripgrep] and enables it to search in pdf, docx, sqlite, jpg, movie subtitles (mkv, mp4), etc.

For more detail, see this introductory blogpost: https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2019/rga--ripgrep-for-zip-targz-docx-odt-epub-jpg/

rga will recursively descend into archives and match text in every file type it knows.

Here is an [example directory](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all/tree/master/exampledir/demo) with different file types:

```
demo/
├── greeting.mkv
├── hello.odt
├── hello.sqlite3
└── somearchive.zip
├── dir
│ ├── greeting.docx
│ └── inner.tar.gz
│ └── greeting.pdf
└── greeting.epub
```

## Integration with fzf

![rga-fzf](doc/rga-fzf.gif)

You can use rga interactively via fzf. Add the following to your ~/.{bash,zsh}rc:

```bash
rga-fzf() {
	RG_PREFIX="rga --files-with-matches"
	local file
	file="$(
		FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="$RG_PREFIX '$1'" \
			fzf --sort --preview="[[ ! -z {} ]] && rga --pretty --context 5 {q} {}" \
				--phony -q "$1" \
				--bind "change:reload:$RG_PREFIX {q}" \
				--preview-window="70%:wrap"
	)" &&
	echo "opening $file" &&
	xdg-open "$file"
}
```

## INSTALLATION

Linux x64, macOS and Windows binaries are available [in GitHub Releases][latestrelease].

[latestrelease]: https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all/releases/latest

### Linux

#### Arch Linux
simply install from AUR: `yay -S ripgrep-all`.

#### Nix
`nix-env -iA nixpkgs.ripgrep-all`

#### Debian-based
download the [rga binary][latestrelease] and get the dependencies like this:

`apt install ripgrep pandoc poppler-utils ffmpeg`

If ripgrep is not included in your package sources, get it from [here](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases).

rga will search for all binaries it calls in \$PATH and the directory itself is in.

### Windows

Install ripgrep-all via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ripgrep-all):

```
choco install ripgrep-all
```

Note that installing via chocolatey or scoop is the only supported download method. If you download the binary from releases manually, you will not get the dependencies (for example pdftotext from poppler).

If you get an error like `VCRUNTIME140.DLL could not be found`, you need to install [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

### Homebrew/Linuxbrew

`rga` can be installed with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ripgrep-all#default):

`brew install rga`

To install the dependencies that are each not strictly necessary but very useful:

`brew install pandoc poppler tesseract ffmpeg`

### Compile from source

rga should compile with stable Rust (v1.36.0+, check with `rustc --version`). To build it, run the following (or the equivalent in your OS):

```
   ~$ apt install build-essential pandoc poppler-utils ffmpeg ripgrep cargo
   ~$ cargo install ripgrep_all
   ~$ rga --version    # this should work now
```

## Available Adapters

```
rga --rga-list-adapters
```

<!-- this part generated by update-readme.sh -->

Adapters:

-   **ffmpeg**
    Uses ffmpeg to extract video metadata/chapters and subtitles  
     Extensions: .mkv, .mp4, .avi

*   **pandoc**
    Uses pandoc to convert binary/unreadable text documents to plain markdown-like text  
     Extensions: .epub, .odt, .docx, .fb2, .ipynb

-   **poppler**
    Uses pdftotext (from poppler-utils) to extract plain text from PDF files  
     Extensions: .pdf  
     Mime Types: application/pdf

-   **zip**
    Reads a zip file as a stream and recurses down into its contents  
     Extensions: .zip  
     Mime Types: application/zip

-   **decompress**
    Reads compressed file as a stream and runs a different extractor on the contents.  
     Extensions: .tgz, .tbz, .tbz2, .gz, .bz2, .xz, .zst  
     Mime Types: application/gzip, application/x-bzip, application/x-xz, application/zstd

-   **tar**
    Reads a tar file as a stream and recurses down into its contents  
     Extensions: .tar

*   **sqlite**
    Uses sqlite bindings to convert sqlite databases into a simple plain text format  
     Extensions: .db, .db3, .sqlite, .sqlite3  
     Mime Types: application/x-sqlite3

The following adapters are disabled by default, and can be enabled using '--rga-adapters=+pdfpages,tesseract':

-   **pdfpages**
    Converts a pdf to its individual pages as png files. Only useful in combination with tesseract  
     Extensions: .pdf  
     Mime Types: application/pdf

-   **tesseract**
    Uses tesseract to run OCR on images to make them searchable. May need -j1 to prevent overloading the system. Make sure you have tesseract installed.  
     Extensions: .jpg, .png

## USAGE:

> rga \[RGA OPTIONS\] \[RG OPTIONS\] PATTERN \[PATH \...\]

## FLAGS:

**\--rga-accurate**

> Use more accurate but slower matching by mime type
>
> By default, rga will match files using file extensions. Some programs,
> such as sqlite3, don\'t care about the file extension at all, so users
> sometimes use any or no extension at all. With this flag, rga will try
> to detect the mime type of input files using the magic bytes (similar
> to the \`file\` utility), and use that to choose the adapter.
> Detection is only done on the first 8KiB of the file, since we can\'t
> always seek on the input (in archives).

**-h**, **\--help**

> Prints help information

**\--rga-list-adapters**

> List all known adapters

**\--rga-no-cache**

> Disable caching of results
>
> By default, rga caches the extracted text, if it is small enough, to a
> database in \~/.cache/rga on Linux, _\~/Library/Caches/rga_ on macOS,
> or C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\rga on Windows. This way,
> repeated searches on the same set of files will be much faster. If you
> pass this flag, all caching will be disabled.

**\--rg-help**

> Show help for ripgrep itself

**\--rg-version**

> Show version of ripgrep itself

**-V**, **\--version**

> Prints version information

## OPTIONS:

**\--rga-adapters=**\<adapters\>\...

> Change which adapters to use and in which priority order (descending)
>
> \"foo,bar\" means use only adapters foo and bar. \"-bar,baz\" means
> use all default adapters except for bar and baz. \"+bar,baz\" means
> use all default adapters and also bar and baz.

**\--rga-cache-compression-level=**\<cache-compression-level\>

> ZSTD compression level to apply to adapter outputs before storing in
> cache db
>
> Ranges from 1 - 22 \[default: 12\]

**\--rga-cache-max-blob-len=**\<cache-max-blob-len\>

> Max compressed size to cache
>
> Longest byte length (after compression) to store in cache. Longer
> adapter outputs will not be cached and recomputed every time. Allowed
> suffixes: k M G \[default: 2000000\]

**\--rga-max-archive-recursion=**\<max-archive-recursion\>

> Maximum nestedness of archives to recurse into \[default: 4\]

**-h** shows a concise overview, **\--help** shows more detail and
advanced options.

All other options not shown here are passed directly to rg, especially
\[PATTERN\] and \[PATH \...\]

## Development

To enable debug logging:

```bash
export RUST_LOG=debug
export RUST_BACKTRACE=1
```

Also remember to disable caching with `--rga-no-cache` or clear the cache
(`~/Library/Caches/rga` on macOS, `~/.cache/rga` on other Unixes,
or `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\rga` on Windows)
to debug the adapters.
