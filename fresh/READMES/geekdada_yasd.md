## What is Surge Web Dashboard?

We are happy to announce Surge Web Dashboard (formerly YASD) has joined Surge! This project will remain open-source and active.

Starting from Surge iOS 4.4.0 and Surge Mac 4.0.0, Surge added support for [HTTP API](https://manual.nssurge.com/others/http-api.html), which makes it possible to control Surge from a browser.

You can use Surge Web Dashboard to control policies, inspect requests and more from another device!

## How-to

Surge has Surge Web Dashboard built in now, you can turn it on in advance settings (it may require a subscription to activate built-in Surge Web Dashboard).

We also provide standalone version, so you can manage all Surge instances at one place (it may require a subscription to activate HTTP API).

- [HTTP](http://yasd.nerdynerd.org)
- [HTTPS](https://yasd.royli.dev)

You can also find the full bundle in [releases](https://github.com/geekdada/yasd/releases) and deploy yourself.
