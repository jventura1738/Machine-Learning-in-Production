variables into numeric by means of different techniques.

Installation
------------

The package requires: `numpy`, `statsmodels`, and `scipy`.

To install the package, execute:

```shell
$ python setup.py install
```

or 

```shell
pip install category_encoders
```

or

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge category_encoders
```

To install the development version, you may use:

```shell
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/category_encoders
```

Usage
-----

All of the encoders are fully compatible sklearn transformers, so they can be used in pipelines or in your existing 
scripts. Supported input formats include numpy arrays and pandas dataframes. If the cols parameter isn't passed, all 
columns with object or pandas categorical data type will be encoded. Please see the docs for transformer-specific 
configuration options.

Examples
--------
There are two types of encoders: unsupervised and supervised. An unsupervised example:
```python
from category_encoders import *
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston

# prepare some data
bunch = load_boston()
y = bunch.target
X = pd.DataFrame(bunch.data, columns=bunch.feature_names)

# use binary encoding to encode two categorical features
enc = BinaryEncoder(cols=['CHAS', 'RAD']).fit(X)

# transform the dataset
numeric_dataset = enc.transform(X)
```

And a supervised example:
```python
from category_encoders import *
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston

# prepare some data
bunch = load_boston()
y_train = bunch.target[0:250]
y_test = bunch.target[250:506]
X_train = pd.DataFrame(bunch.data[0:250], columns=bunch.feature_names)
X_test = pd.DataFrame(bunch.data[250:506], columns=bunch.feature_names)

# use target encoding to encode two categorical features
enc = TargetEncoder(cols=['CHAS', 'RAD'])

# transform the datasets
training_numeric_dataset = enc.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
testing_numeric_dataset = enc.transform(X_test)
```

For the transformation of the _training_ data with the supervised methods, you should use `fit_transform()` method instead of `fit().transform()`, because these two methods _do not_ have to generate the same result. The difference can be observed with LeaveOneOut encoder, which performs a nested cross-validation for the _training_ data in `fit_transform()` method (to decrease over-fitting of the downstream model) but uses all the training data for scoring with `transform()` method (to get as accurate estimates as possible).

Furthermore, you may benefit from following wrappers:
 * PolynomialWrapper, which extends supervised encoders to support polynomial targets
 * NestedCVWrapper, which helps to prevent overfitting  

Additional examples and benchmarks can be found in the `examples` directory.
