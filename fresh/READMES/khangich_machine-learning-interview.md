## Study guide
### LeetCode (not all companies ask Leetcode questions)
[<img src="images/LC.png">](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RCb1dVQCLmtOGlJ5J-NJ5pIC7Tda-N2U/edit#gid=274831950)

- NOTE: there are a lot of companies that do **NOT** ask leetcode questions. There are many paths to become an MLE, you can create your own path if you feel like leetcoding is a waste of time. 

- I use [LC time tracking](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RCb1dVQCLmtOGlJ5J-NJ5pIC7Tda-N2U/edit#gid=274831950) to keep track of how many times I solves a question and how long I spent each time. Once I finish non-trivial medium LC questions 3 times, I have absolutely no issues solving them in actual interviews (sometimes within 8-10 minutes). It makes a big difference. A better way is to use **LeetPlug** chrome extension [here](https://leetplug.azurewebsites.net/static/pages/howto.html)

 [Leetcode questions by categories](https://mlengineer.io/common-leetcode-questions-by-categories-532b301130b?sk=cf77975462cb0c96e6a6daebaa3ab7b9)

## Intro

* This repo is written based on REAL interview questions from big companies and the study materials are based on legit experts i.e Andrew Ng, Yoshua Bengio etc. 

* I have 6 YOE in Machine Learning and have interviewed more than dozen big companies. This is the **minimum** viable study plan that covers all actual interview questions from Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google, MS, SnapChat, Linkedin etc. 

* If you're interested to learn more about paid ML system design course, [click here](course.md). This course will provide 6-7 practical usecases with proven solutions. After this course you will be able to solve new problem with systematic approach.
