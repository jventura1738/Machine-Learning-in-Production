# TimeZone-Alfred

Do you like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)? I like too… I’ve recently found bunch of very nice Workflows. For me, the most used one is for sure Time Zone.

### Now compatible with Alfred 4!

The workflow has been created by Mr Carlos from New Zealand and published on the [Alfred Forum](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/491-timezones-a-world-clock-script-filter-updated-to-v17/). I’ve enhanced the workflow by adding a few new functionalities:

* Converting any time to all pre-defined time zones
* Enabling 24-hrs time format
* Displaying phone country code

After all it looks like below:

Conversion of a time in your local time to your pre-defined time-zones – “tz <time>” in formats HH, HHMM or HH:MM:

Conversion of a time in a timezone from your list (Warsaw in the sample) with modified date (plus 3 days in the sample):

### UTC Support

You can add UTC zones: just search the zone using keyword `timezone add universal` or `timezone add coordinated`:

## Commands

* **Keyword**: *tz* (or hotkey) - bring up the list of saved cities with their respective current times. (Keep typing the name of a place for a one-off lookup.)
* **Keyword**: *tz [part of city name]* - searches for a city in your cities that matches that name and shows the current time.

* **Keyword**: *tz [`date modifier`] [`time`]* - (where `time` is as above and `date modifier` is 'today' (short: 't'), or 'tomorrow' (short: 'tm'), or `[number of days]d` what means to add the number of days to current date, or one of `dd`, `mmdd`, `yymmdd`, `yyyymmdd` to give an absolute date) - convert provided date and time into time of your cities.
* **Keyword**: *tz [`source city`] [`date`] [`time`]* - (where `time` and `date` are as above and `source city` is used to search in your city list) - assumes that date and time is given in the timezone of provided source city and converts it into time of your (other) cities.
