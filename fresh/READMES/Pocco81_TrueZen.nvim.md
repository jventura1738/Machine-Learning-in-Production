# TL;DR

<div style="text-align: justify">
	TrueZen.nvim is a NeoVim plugin written in Lua that aims to provide a cleaner and less cluttered interface [than usual] when toggled in either of it's three different modes (Ataraxis, Minimalist and Focus). It can be installed with your favorite plugin manager and has some sane defaults so that you can just execute ':TZAtaraxis' to get started!

## Updating
This depends on your plugin manager. If, for example, you are using Packer.nvim, you can update it with this command:
```lua
:PackerUpdate
```

# ü§ñ Usage (commands)
All the commands follow the *camel casing* naming convention and have the `TZ` prefix so that it's easy to remember that they are part of this plugin. These are all of them:

## Default
- `:TZMinimalist` toggles Minimalist mode. Activates/deactivates NeoVim's UI components from the left, bottom and top of NeoVim on all the buffers you enter in the current session.
- `:TZFocus` toggles Focus mode. Maximizes/minimizes the current window.
- `:TZAtaraxis` toggles Ataraxis mode. Ataraxis is kind of a "super extension" of Minimalist mode that uses it for deactivating UI components, however, it also provides padding to all buffers in the current session + makes use of the different integrations. Furthermore, you could also set values for the padding of the left (`l`), right (`r`), top (`t`), and bottom (`b`) of the Ataraxis instance you are about to spawn. This values are optional and when given their equivalent from the config is ignored. They should be separated by spaces and the format they should have is: `<(l)eft/(r)ight>/(t)op/(b)ottom<number_of_cells>`. Here is an example:

```
:TZAtaraxis l10 r10 t3 b1
```
Note: it's not mandatory to give all four of them.

## UI Elements
- `:TZBottom` toggles the bottom part of NeoVim's UI. It toggles: laststatus, ruler, showmode, showcmd, and cmdheight.
- `:TZTop` toggles the top part of NeoVim's UI. It toggles: tabline.
- `:TZLeft` toggles the left part of NeoVim's UI. It toggles: numbers, relative numbers, and signcolumn.

## On/Off
- `:TZAtaraxisOn` turns on Ataraxis mode.
- `:TZAtaraxisOff` turns off Ataraxis mode.
- `:TZMinimalistOn` turns on Minimalist mode.
- `:TZMinimalistOff` turns off Minimalist mode.
- `:TZFocusOn` turns on Focus mode
- `:TZFocusOff` turns off Focus mode

The following commands are enabled is the `ui_elements_commands` setting is set to true as well:

- `:TZBottomOn` show bottom UI parts.
- `:TZBottomOff` hide bottom UI parts.
- `:TZTopOn` show top UI parts.
- `:TZTopOff` hide top UI parts.
- `:TZLeftOn` show left UI parts.
- `:TZLeftOff` hide left UI parts

# üçâ Configuration
Although settings already have self-explanatory names, here is where you can find info about each one of them and their classifications!

## UI
These settings are part of the `ui = {}` table and control Nvim's UI when toggling either Minimalist or Ataraxis mode. Those settings have the exact same names they have in NeoVim, so there is no need to explain what they do. If you need help with any of them use `:help <setting_name>`. Note that every setting belongs to a table that represents the part of the UI they are part of, for example: the setting `showtabline` is part of the `top = {}` table because visually it's part of the top part of NeoVim.

## Modes
They are part of the `modes = {}` table and control the settings for the different modes TrueZen provides!

### Ataraxis
+ `left_padding`: (Integer) sets padding for the left.
+ `right_padding`: (Integer) sets padding for the right.
+ `top_padding`: (Integer) sets padding for the top.
+ `bottom_padding`: (Integer) sets padding for the bottom.
+ `just_do_it_for_me`: (Boolean) if true, it will ignore `left_padding` and `right_padding` and will set them for you.
+ `keep_default_fold_fillchars`: (Boolean) Keep default fold fillchars. Useful if you want the mouse to keep working.
+ `ideal_writing_area_width`: (Integer) sets an ideal width for the writing area. Setting it to `0` disables it, any number greater than `0` does the opposite, which will then ignore the `just_do_it_for_me`, the `left_padding`, and the `right_padding` settings for obvious reasons. For example: if you set it to `20` you will always get a writing area or `20` and both the `left` and the `right` hand side paddings will be set automatically. This feature is useful for people with various monitors with different sizes.
+ `affected_higroups`: (Table) receives a table with all of the Hi Groups that get affected by TrueZen. Every key must match the name of an existing hi group and every value must be an empty table.
+ `bg_configuration`: (Boolean) if true, allows TrueZen to interact with the user's background. Set it to false only if you are having problems with it. (Note: Refer to the FAQ about this)
+ `custome_bg` (String) used for setting a backgroups color if your colorscheme doesn't provide one already/you don't want to set one for Nvim as a whole but only for TrueZen.nvim. If you already have a BG color, leave the quotes empty. Refer to the FAQ about this.

### Focus
+ `margin_of_error`: (Integer > 1) adjusts MOE (margin of error). Less = more precision, however, it's recommended to keep the defaults, or at least a number >= 2. This only matters if `focus_method` is set to `"native"`.
+ `focus_method`: (String: "native"/"experimental") sets focusing method. `"native"` uses "vim's way" of focusing windows. The drawback of this method is that it tends to break if you resize the terminal. `"experimental"` is a new way of focusing windows that allows for free terminal resizing.

## Integrations
These settings are part of the `integrations = {}` table and can be used to enable or disable integrations.

- `galaxyline`: (Boolean) if true, hides galaxyline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
- `vim_airline`: (Boolean) if true, hides vim airline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
- `vim_powerline`: (Boolean) if true, hides vim powerline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
- `express_line`: (Boolean) if true, hides expressline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
- `lualine`: (Boolean) if true, hides lualine when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
- `tmux`: (Boolean) if true, hides Tmuxs' statusline when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
- `gitgutter`: (Boolean) if true, disables Gitgutter when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
- `vim_signify`: (Boolean) if true, disables Vim Signify when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back on after exiting it.
- `limelight`: (Boolean) if true, enables Limelight when Ataraxis mode is on and toggles it back off after exiting it.
- `gitsigns`: (Boolean) if true, disables Gitsigns' elements when Ataraxis mode is on and enables them after exiting it.

## Misc
+ `on_off_commands`: (Boolean) if true, enables [On/Off commands](#onoff).
+ `ui_elements_commands`: (Boolean) if true, enables [commands for the UI elements](#ui-elements).
+ `cursor_by_mode`: (Boolean) if true, changes the cursors' shape according to the current Vi mode. Useful for when the statuline and showmode are hidden so that one can easily identify the current mode.

## Events
Use them to execute code at certain events [described by the names they have]. These are the ones available:

| Mode       | Function Name              |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Focus      | before_mode_focus_on       |
| Focus      | after_mode_focus_on        |
| Focus      | before_mode_focus_off      |
| Focus      | after_mode_focus_off       |
| Minimalist | before_mode_minimalist_on  |
| Minimalist | after_mode_minimalist_on   |
| Minimalist | before_mode_minimalist_off |
| Minimalist | after_mode_minimalist_off  |
| Ataraxis   | before_mode_ataraxis_on    |
| Ataraxis   | after_mode_ataraxis_on     |
| Ataraxis   | before_mode_ataraxis_off   |
| Ataraxis   | after_mode_ataraxis_off    |

They can be used like so:

```lua
local true_zen = require("true-zen")

true_zen.after_mode_ataraxis_on = function ()
	print("hi!")
end
```

# üßª Key-bindings
There are no default key-bindings. However,  you can set them on your own as you'd normally do! Here is an example mapping `<F12>` to toggle `Ataraxis` mode:

**For init.lua**
```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<F12>", [[<Cmd>TZAtaraxis<CR>]], opt)
```

**For init.vim**
```vimscript
map <F12> :TZAtaraxis<CR>
```

# üôã FAQ

- Q: ***"How can I make it launch at startup?"***
- A: Easy! Just copy and paste this:

For **init.lua**:
```lua
vim.cmd("autocmd VimEnter * TZAtaraxis")
```

For **init.vim**:
```vimscript
autocmd VimEnter * TZAtaraxis
```

- Q: ***"How can I view the doc from NeoVim?"***
- A: Use `:help TrueZen.nvim`

- Q: ***"Why isn't my statusline being hidden when I toggle Ataraxis mode?"***
- A: If your statusline does not have an integration, TrueZen will try its best to hide it. If it fails, then open an issue and request for the integration, and in the mean time use the built-in [events](#events).

- Q: ***Getting this error: `E420: BG color unknown`. How do I solve this?***
- A: This issue occurs because:
1. You don't have `set termguicolors` in your init.vim (or `vim.cmd("set termguicolors")` in your init.lua). If that didn't help, use the `custome_bg = "<hex_code>/<normal_color>"` setting to set a bg color for TrueZen, this solution *should* deffinately work. This will set a bg for TrueZen to use. If possible try to set it to match your normal Nvim background color.

and/or

2. Your current colorscheme doesn't provide a background (bg) color. To test the latter, run this command: `highlight StatusLineNC ctermfg=bg ctermbg=bg guibg=bg guifg=bg`. If you get an error, you can follow the above case's intructions to set it only for TrueZen or you could add the *hi* so that it'll affect nvim as a whole:
```
hi NORMAL guibg=<color/hex_code>
" e.g.:
" hi NORMAL guibg=#1e222a
```

If you don't fit in either of the above cases/the fixes didn't work for you, then disable BG interaction between TrueZen and NeoVim (your colorscheme in this case) with the `disable_bg_configuration` setting under the `ataraxis = {}` table.


If you already tried everything of the above and *nothing worked* (which I doubt), then it's an issue with your Colorscheme, not a TrueZen.nvim one!
