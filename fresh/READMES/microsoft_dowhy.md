As computing systems are more frequently and more actively intervening in societally critical domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, it is critical to correctly predict and understand the causal effects of these interventions. Without an A/B test, conventional machine learning methods, built on pattern recognition and correlational analyses, are insufficient for decision-making. 

Much like machine learning libraries have done for prediction, **"DoWhy" is a Python library that aims to spark causal thinking and analysis**. DoWhy provides a principled four-step interface for causal inference that focuses on explicitly modeling causal assumptions and validating them as much as possible. The key feature of DoWhy is its state-of-the-art refutation API that can automatically test causal assumptions for any estimation method, thus making inference more robust and accessible to non-experts. DoWhy supports estimation of the average causal effect for backdoor, frontdoor, instrumental variable and other identification methods, and estimation of the conditional effect (CATE) through an integration with the EconML library.  

For a quick introduction to causal inference, check out `amit-sharma/causal-inference-tutorial <https://github.com/amit-sharma/causal-inference-tutorial/>`_. We also gave a more comprehensive tutorial at the ACM Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (`KDD 2018 <http://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/>`_) conference: `causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial <http://causalinference.gitlab.io/kdd-tutorial/>`_.

The need for causal inference
----------------------------------

Predictive models uncover patterns that connect the inputs and outcome in observed data. To intervene, however, we need to estimate the effect of changing an input from its current value, for which no data exists. Such questions, involving estimating a *counterfactual*, are common in decision-making scenarios.

* Will it work?
    * Does a proposed change to a system improve people's outcomes?
* Why did it work?
    * What led to a change in a system's outcome?
* What should we do?
    * What changes to a system are likely to improve outcomes for people?
* What are the overall effects?
    * How does the system interact with human behavior?
    * What is the effect of a system's recommendations on people's activity?

Answering these questions requires causal reasoning. While many methods exist
for causal inference, it is hard to compare their assumptions and robustness of results. DoWhy makes three contributions,

1. Provides a principled way of modeling a given problem as a causal graph so
   that all assumptions are explicit.
2. Provides a unified interface for many popular causal inference methods, combining the two major frameworks of graphical models and potential outcomes.
3. Automatically tests for the validity of assumptions if possible and assesses
   the robustness of the estimate to violations.

To see DoWhy in action, check out how it can be applied to estimate the effect
of a subscription or rewards program for customers [`Rewards notebook
<https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_example_effect_of_memberrewards_program.ipynb>`_] and for implementing and evaluating causal inference methods on benchmark datasets like the `Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_ihdp_data_example.ipynb>`_ dataset, `Infant Mortality (Twins) <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_twins_example.ipynb>`_ dataset, and the `Lalonde Jobs <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_lalonde_example.ipynb>`_ dataset.

If that does not work, then use :code:`conda config --set channel_priority false` and try to install again. If the problem persists, please add your issue `here <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/issues/197>`_.

**Development Version**

If you prefer the latest dev version, clone this repository and run the following command from the top-most folder of
the repository.

.. code:: shell
    
    pip install -e .

**Requirements**

DoWhy requires the following packages:

* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* networkx  (for analyzing causal graphs)
* matplotlib (for general plotting)
* sympy (for rendering symbolic expressions)

If you face any problems, try installing dependencies manually.

.. code:: shell
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Optionally, if you wish to input graphs in the dot format, then install pydot (or pygraphviz).


For better-looking graphs, you can optionally install pygraphviz. To proceed,
first install graphviz and then pygraphviz (on Ubuntu and Ubuntu WSL).

.. code:: shell

    sudo apt install graphviz libgraphviz-dev graphviz-dev pkg-config
    ## from https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/issues/71
    pip install pygraphviz --install-option="--include-path=/usr/include/graphviz" \
    --install-option="--library-path=/usr/lib/graphviz/"

Sample causal inference analysis in DoWhy
-------------------------------------------
Most DoWhy
analyses for causal inference take 4 lines to write, assuming a
pandas dataframe df that contains the data:

.. code:: python

    from dowhy import CausalModel
    import dowhy.datasets

    # Load some sample data
    data = dowhy.datasets.linear_dataset(
        beta=10,
        num_common_causes=5,
        num_instruments=2,
        num_samples=10000,
        treatment_is_binary=True)

DoWhy supports two formats for providing the causal graph: `gml <https://github.com/GunterMueller/UNI_PASSAU_FMI_Graph_Drawing>`_ (preferred) and `dot <http://www.graphviz.org/documentation/>`_. After loading in the data, we use the four main operations in DoWhy: *model*,
*estimate*, *identify* and *refute*:

.. code:: python

    # I. Create a causal model from the data and given graph.
    model = CausalModel(
        data=data["df"],
        treatment=data["treatment_name"],
        outcome=data["outcome_name"],
        graph=data["gml_graph"])

    # II. Identify causal effect and return target estimands
    identified_estimand = model.identify_effect()

    # III. Estimate the target estimand using a statistical method.
    estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand,
                                     method_name="backdoor.propensity_score_matching")

    # IV. Refute the obtained estimate using multiple robustness checks.
    refute_results = model.refute_estimate(identified_estimand, estimate,
                                           method_name="random_common_cause")

DoWhy stresses on the interpretability of its output. At any point in the analysis,
you can inspect the untested assumptions, identified estimands (if any) and the
estimate (if any). Here's a sample output of the linear regression estimator.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/dowhy/master/docs/images/regression_output.png

For a full code example, check out the `Getting Started with DoWhy <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_simple_example.ipynb>`_ notebook. You can also use Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation methods from other libraries such as EconML and CausalML, as shown in the `Conditional Treatment Effects <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy-conditional-treatment-effects.ipynb>`_ notebook. For more examples of using DoWhy, check out the Jupyter notebooks in `docs/source/example_notebooks <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/tree/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/>`_ or try them online at `Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/microsoft/dowhy/master?filepath=docs%2Fsource%2F>`_. 


A high-level Pandas API
-----------------------

We've made an even simpler API for dowhy which is a light layer on top of the standard one. The goal is to make causal analysis much more like regular exploratory analysis. To use this API, simply
import :code:`dowhy.api`. This will magically add the :code:`causal` namespace to your
:code:`pandas.DataFrame` s. Then,
you can use the namespace as follows.

.. code:: python

    import dowhy.api
    import dowhy.datasets

    data = dowhy.datasets.linear_dataset(beta=5,
        num_common_causes=1,
        num_instruments = 0,
        num_samples=1000,
        treatment_is_binary=True)

    # data['df'] is just a regular pandas.DataFrame
    data['df'].causal.do(x='v0', # name of treatment variable
                         variable_types={'v0': 'b', 'y': 'c', 'W0': 'c'},
                         outcome='y',
                         common_causes=['W0']).groupby('v0').mean().plot(y='y', kind='bar')

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/dowhy/master/docs/images/do_barplot.png

For some methods, the :code:`variable_types` field must be specified. It should be a :code:`dict`, where the keys are
variable names, and values are 'o' for ordered discrete, 'u' for un-ordered discrete, 'd' for discrete, or 'c'
for continuous.

**Note:If the** :code:`variable_types` **is not specified we make use of the following implicit conversions:**
::

   int -> 'c'
   float -> 'c'
   binary -> 'b'
   category -> 'd'

**Currently we have not added support for timestamps.**

The :code:`do` method in the causal namespace generates a random sample from $P(outcome|do(X=x))$ of the
same length as your data set, and returns this outcome as a new :code:`DataFrame`. You can continue to perform
the usual :code:`DataFrame` operations with this sample, and so you can compute statistics and create plots
for causal outcomes!

The :code:`do` method is built on top of the lower-level :code:`dowhy` objects, so can still take a graph and perform
identification automatically when you provide a graph instead of :code:`common_causes`.

For more details, check out the `Pandas API
<https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_causal_api.ipynb>`_ notebook or the `Do Sampler <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/do_sampler_demo.ipynb>`_
notebook. 

Graphical Models and Potential Outcomes: Best of both worlds
============================================================
DoWhy builds on two of the most powerful frameworks for causal inference:
graphical models and potential outcomes. It uses graph-based criteria and
do-calculus for modeling assumptions and identifying a non-parametric causal effect.
For estimation, it switches to methods based primarily on potential outcomes.

A unifying language for causal inference
----------------------------------------

DoWhy is based on a simple unifying language for causal inference. Causal
inference may seem tricky, but almost all methods follow four key steps:

1. Model a causal inference problem using assumptions.
2. Identify an expression for the causal effect under these assumptions ("causal estimand").
3. Estimate the expression using statistical methods such as matching or instrumental variables.
4. Finally, verify the validity of the estimate using a variety of robustness checks.

This workflow can be captured by four key verbs in DoWhy:

- model
- identify
- estimate
- refute

Using these verbs, DoWhy implements a causal inference engine that can support 
a variety of methods. *model* encodes prior knowledge as a formal causal graph, *identify* uses 
graph-based methods to identify the causal effect, *estimate* uses  
statistical methods for estimating the identified estimand, and finally *refute* 
tries to refute the obtained estimate by testing robustness to assumptions.

Key differences compared to available causal inference software
----------------------------------------------------------------
DoWhy brings three key differences compared to available software for causal inference:

**Explicit identifying assumptions**
    Assumptions are first-class citizens in DoWhy.

    Each analysis starts with a
    building a causal model. The assumptions can be viewed graphically or in terms
    of conditional independence statements. Wherever possible, DoWhy can also
    automatically test for stated assumptions using observed data.

**Separation between identification and estimation**
    Identification is the causal problem. Estimation is simply a statistical problem.

    DoWhy
    respects this boundary and treats them separately. This focuses the causal
    inference effort on identification, and frees up estimation using any
    available statistical estimator for a target estimand. In addition, multiple
    estimation methods can be used for a single identified_estimand and
    vice-versa.

**Automated robustness checks**
    What happens when key identifying assumptions may not be satisfied?

    The most critical, and often skipped, part of causal analysis is checking the
    robustness of an estimate to unverified assumptions. DoWhy makes it easy to
    automatically run sensitivity and robustness checks on the obtained estimate.

Finally, DoWhy is easily extensible, allowing other implementations of the
four verbs to co-exist (e.g., we support implementations of the *estimation* verb from 
EconML and CausalML libraries). The four verbs are mutually independent, so their
implementations can be combined in any way.



Below are more details about the current implementation of each of these verbs.

Four steps of causal inference
===============================

I. Model a causal problem
-----------------------------

DoWhy creates an underlying causal graphical model for each problem. This
serves to make each causal assumption explicit. This graph need not be
complete---you can provide a partial graph, representing prior
knowledge about some of the variables. DoWhy automatically considers the rest
of the variables as potential confounders.

Currently, DoWhy supports two formats for graph input: `gml <https://github.com/GunterMueller/UNI_PASSAU_FMI_Graph_Drawing>`_ (preferred) and
`dot <http://www.graphviz.org/documentation/>`_. We strongly suggest to use gml as the input format, as it works well with networkx. You can provide the graph either as a .gml file or as a string. If you prefer to use dot format, you will need to install additional packages (pydot or pygraphviz, see the installation section above). Both .dot files and string format are supported. 

While not recommended, you can also specify common causes and/or instruments directly
instead of providing a graph.

Supported formats for specifying causal assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Graph**: Provide a causal graph in either gml or dot format. Can be a text file
  or a string.
* **Named variable sets**: Instead of the graph, provide variable names that
  correspond to relevant categories, such as common causes, instrumental variables, effect
  modifiers, frontdoor variables, etc.

Examples of how to instantiate a causal model are in the `Getting Started
<https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_simple_example.ipynb>`_
notebook.

.. i comment image:: causal_model.png

II. Identify a target estimand under the model
----------------------------------------------

Based on the causal graph, DoWhy finds all possible ways of identifying a desired causal effect based on
the graphical model. It uses graph-based criteria and do-calculus to find
potential ways find expressions that can identify the causal effect. 

Supported identification criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Back-door criterion
* Front-door criterion
* Instrumental Variables
* Mediation (Direct and indirect effect identification)

Different notebooks illustrate how to use these identification criteria. Check
out the `Simple Backdoor <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_confounder_example.ipynb>`_ notebook for the back-door criterion, and the `Simple IV <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy-simple-iv-example.ipynb>`_ notebook for the instrumental variable criterion.

III. Estimate causal effect based on the identified estimand
------------------------------------------------------------

DoWhy supports methods based on both back-door criterion and instrumental
variables. It also provides a non-parametric confidence intervals and a permutation test for testing
the statistical significance of obtained estimate. 

Supported estimation methods 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Methods based on estimating the treatment assignment
    * Propensity-based Stratification
    * Propensity Score Matching
    * Inverse Propensity Weighting

* Methods based on estimating the outcome model
    * Linear Regression
    * Generalized Linear Models

* Methods based on the instrumental variable equation
    * Binary Instrument/Wald Estimator
    * Two-stage least squares
    * Regression discontinuity

* Methods for front-door criterion and general mediation
    * Two-stage linear regression

Examples of using these methods are in the `Estimation methods
<https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_estimation_methods.ipynb>`_
notebook. 

Using EconML and CausalML estimation methods in DoWhy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is easy to call external estimation methods using DoWhy. Currently we
support integrations with the `EconML <https://github.com/microsoft/econml>`_ and `CausalML <https://github.com/uber/causalml>`_ packages. Here's an example
of estimating conditional treatment effects using EconML's double machine
learning estimator.

.. code:: python
	
	from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
	from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV
	from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
	dml_estimate = model.estimate_effect(identified_estimand, method_name="backdoor.econml.dml.DML",
                        control_value = 0,
                        treatment_value = 1,
                        target_units = lambda df: df["X0"]>1,
                        confidence_intervals=False,
                        method_params={
                            "init_params":{'model_y':GradientBoostingRegressor(),
                                           'model_t': GradientBoostingRegressor(),
                                           'model_final':LassoCV(), 
                                           'featurizer':PolynomialFeatures(degree=1, include_bias=True)},
                            "fit_params":{}}
						)


More examples are in the `Conditional Treatment Effects with DoWhy
<https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy-conditional-treatment-effects.ipynb>`_ notebook. 

IV. Refute the obtained estimate
-------------------------------------
Having access to multiple refutation methods to validate an effect estimate from a
causal estimator is
a key benefit of using DoWhy.

Supported refutation methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Add Random Common Cause**: Does the estimation method change its estimate after
  we add an independent random variable as a common cause to the dataset?
  (*Hint: It should not*)
* **Placebo Treatment**: What happens to the estimated causal effect when we
  replace the true treatment variable with an independent random variable?
  (*Hint: the effect should go to zero*)
* **Dummy Outcome**: What happens to the estimated causal effect when we replace
  the true outcome variable with an independent random variable? (*Hint: The
  effect should go to zero*)
* **Simulated Outcome**: What happens to the estimated causal effect when we
  replace the dataset with a simulated dataset based on a known data-generating
  process closest to the given dataset? (*Hint: It should match the effect parameter
  from the data-generating process*)
* **Add Unobserved Common Causes**: How sensitive is the effect estimate when we
  add an additional common cause (confounder) to the dataset that is correlated
  with the treatment and the outcome? (*Hint: It should not be too sensitive*)
* **Data Subsets Validation**: Does the estimated effect change significantly when
  we replace the given dataset with a randomly selected subset? (*Hint: It
  should not*)
* **Bootstrap Validation**: Does the estimated effect change significantly when we 
  replace the given dataset with bootstrapped samples from the same dataset? (*Hint: It should not*)

Examples of using refutation methods are in the `Refutations <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_refuter_notebook.ipynb>`_ notebook. For an advanced refutation that uses a simulated dataset based on user-provided or learnt data-generating processes, check out the `Dummy Outcome Refuter <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_demo_dummy_outcome_refuter.ipynb>`_ notebook. 
As a practical example, `this notebook <https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_refutation_testing.ipynb>`_ shows an application of refutation methods on evaluating effect estimators for the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) and Lalonde datasets.
