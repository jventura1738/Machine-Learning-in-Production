## What is Framer X?

[Framer X](https://framer.com/x) is a powerful Interaction Design tool. Please read the **[Official Documentation](https://framer.com/docs/)**.

Framer X comes with a variety of features and capabilities like a Design Store of reusable UI components (powered by NPM). On the store, you will find a collection of interactive design & code components such as maps, random image generators, video and audio players, Design System Kits (iOS & Android) and more.

React components on Framer X can be written in **`TypeScript`** and/or **`ES6`**.
