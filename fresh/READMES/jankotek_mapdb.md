MapDB combines embedded database engine and Java collections.
It is free under Apache 2 license. MapDB is flexible and can be used in many roles:

* Drop-in replacement for Maps, Lists, Queues and other collections.
* Off-heap collections not affected by Garbage Collector
* Multilevel cache with expiration and disk overflow.
* RDBMs replacement with  transactions, MVCC, incremental backups etcâ€¦
* Local data processing and filtering. MapDB has utilities to process huge quantities of data in reasonable time.

Development
--------------------

MapDB is written in Kotlin, you will need IntelliJ Idea.

You can use Gradle to build MapDB.

MapDB is extensively unit-tested.
By default, only tiny fraction of all tests are executed, so build finishes under 10 minutes.
Full test suite has over million test cases and runs for several hours/days.
To run full test suite, set `-Dmdbtest=1` VM option.

Longer unit tests might require more memory. Use this to increase heap memory assigned to unit tests: `-DtestArgLine="-Xmx3G"`

By default unit tests are executed in 3 threads. Thread count is controlled by `-DtestThreadCount=3` property

On machine with limited memory you can change fork mode so unit test consume less RAM, but run longer: `-DtestReuseForks=false`
