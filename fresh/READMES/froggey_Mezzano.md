## Pre-built images

Demo releases are available through [GitHub](https://github.com/froggey/Mezzano/releases).

These releases are designed to be run in VirtualBox, though QEMU is also supported.
2GB of RAM, a virtio-net NIC and an Intel HDA audio controller are recommended.

## Building from source

See the MBuild repo: (https://github.com/froggey/MBuild)
