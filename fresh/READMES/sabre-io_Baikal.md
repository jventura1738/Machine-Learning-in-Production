Baïkal
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sabre-io/Baikal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sabre-io/Baikal)

This is the source repository for the Baïkal CalDAV and CardDAV server.

Head to [sabre.io/baikal][2] for information about installation, upgrading and troubleshooting.

A German tutorial about installation of Baïkal, using it together with Thunderbird, Android and DavX5, sharing calendars, database maintenance and security can be found [here][6]. Its focus is for people with not so much IT experience. Therefore it is very detailed, step by step with a RaspberryPI used as server.

Upgrading
---------

Please follow [the upgrade instructions][5].
