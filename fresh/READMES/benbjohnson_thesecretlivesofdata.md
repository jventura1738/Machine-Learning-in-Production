The Secret Lives of Data
========================

> Understanding what your bits do when you're not looking.

## Overview

So often we use databases and servers without really understanding how they work.
The way that data flows is critical to performance and reliability.

This project seeks to spread the knowledge of our systems through interactive visualization.
If you have a system that you understand and wish to share then please add a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/benbjohnson/thesecretlivesofdata/issues).
Data visualization knowledge is not necessary -- just the desire to spread some knowledge.


## Visualizations

Below is a list of data visualizations and their associated Github issue.
Please report any bugs you find or any suggestions you have for how to make these visualizations more understandable.
