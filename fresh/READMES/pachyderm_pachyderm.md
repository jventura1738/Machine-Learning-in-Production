# Pachyderm: Data Versioning, Data Pipelines, and Data Lineage

Pachyderm is a tool for version-controlled, automated, end-to-end data pipelines for data science. If you need to chain together data scraping, ingestion, cleaning, munging, wrangling, processing,
modeling, and analysis in a sane way, while ensuring the traceability and provenance of your data, Pachyderm is for you. If you have an existing set of scripts which do this in an ad-hoc fashion and you're looking
for a way to "productionize" them, Pachyderm can make this easy for you.

## Features

- Containerized: Pachyderm is built on Docker and Kubernetes. Whatever
  languages or libraries your pipeline needs, they can run on Pachyderm which
  can easily be deployed on any cloud provider or on prem.
- Version Control: Pachyderm version controls your data as it's processed. You
  can always ask the system how data has changed, see a diff, and, if something
  doesn't look right, revert.
- Provenance (aka data lineage): Pachyderm tracks where data comes from. Pachyderm keeps track of all the code and  data that created a result.
- Parallelization: Pachyderm can efficiently schedule massively parallel
  workloads.
- Incremental Processing: Pachyderm understands how your data has changed and
  is smart enough to only process the new data.

## Getting Started
To start deploying your end-to-end version-controlled data pipelines, try us for free on [Hub](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/pachhub/pachhub_getting_started/) with little to no setup or run Pachyderm [locally](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/getting_started/local_installation/). You can also [deploy on AWS/GCE/Azure](https://docs.pachyderm.com/latest/deploy-manage/deploy/amazon_web_services/) in about 5 minutes.
