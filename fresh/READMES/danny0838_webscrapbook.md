*WebScrapBook* is a browser extension that captures the web page faithfully with various archive formats and customizable configurations, for future retrieval, organization, annotation, and editing. This project inherits from legacy Firefox add-on [ScrapBook X](https://github.com/danny0838/firefox-scrapbook).

This extension is available for Chromium-based browsers ([Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scrapbook/oegnpmiddfljlloiklpkeelagaeejfai), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/lodlipoddpmffbngkadebncbbidnambc), Opera, Vivaldi, etc.), and [Firefox for Desktop and Android](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/webscrapbook).

> Mozilla is changing the protocal recently and many add-ons are encounting a severe delay for getting a signature (see [threads](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/add-ons/addons-mozilla-org/109) about the issue on the official forum for details). You can consider installing the [unlisted beta version](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook/tree/gh-pages) (which has only a different name and ID and fortunately their signing are not blocked yet) for now.
