# Should we start to worry?
`bytes-buf` feature can produce **SIGILL**.

`avx` and `sse` flags are in almost all cpus of `x86` and `x86_64` architectures. 

More details in https://github.com/botika/v_escape/issues/54.

Satan has been slaughtered and sent to heaven. Should we start to worry?

# Yarte [![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/yarte.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/yarte) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/botika/yarte.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/botika/yarte)
Yarte stands for **Y**et **A**nother **R**ust **T**emplate **E**ngine. Uses a Handlebars-like syntax, 
well-known and intuitive for most developers. Yarte is an optimized, and easy-to-use 
rust crate, with which developers can create logic around their 
HTML templates using conditionals, loops, rust code and template composition. 

## Features
- Almost all Rust expressions are valid
- Meta programming system with almost all Rust expressions, conditionals, loops, modules and partial recursion
- Low level, SIMD and zero copy runtime
- A [fancy-text debug](https://asciinema.org/a/TQAodSQXevgHgO01vzC6vdo6v?autoplay=1) mode to visualize the code generated by Yarte
- Emit snipped annotations at error
- Improved daily and has full coverage (without stupid bugs that take months or years to fix)

Yarte is under development but some of **its parts are stable**. The **derivations** and **proc_macro**, **text** and **html(not minified)**, and the **json serializer** are stable and with enough coverage to put into production. It is also proposed to integrate Jinja or any other template language so you can reuse your favorite templates, do not migrate them, raise an issue and I will try to give it more priority. 

### Is it really fast?
See it for yourself in the [TechEmpower benchmarks][bench] with [`actix`][actix] and [`ntex`][ntex] 

## Documentation
In order to  fully understand Yarte's capabilities take a look at the following documentation:
- [Tests](./yarte/tests)
- [Our book](https://yarte.netlify.com/)
- [Crate documentation](https://docs.rs/yarte/)
- Minimum supported Rust version: 1.45 or later

Or, in nightly, just:
```rust
#[html] "{{> my_template }}"
```

## Acknowledgment
Yarte is based on all previous templates engines, syntax as well as its documentation 
is highly influenced by [Handlebars][handlebars].

## Contributing
Please, contribute to Yarte! The more the better! Feel free to open an issue and/or contacting directly with the 
owner for any request or suggestion.

I want to move these `yarte`,` v_escape`, `v_eval` and` buf-min` to a team with me as a member.
