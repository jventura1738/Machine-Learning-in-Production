**What is SikuliX**<br>SikuliX automates anything you see on the screen of your desktop computer 
running Windows, Mac or some Linux/Unix. It uses image recognition powered by OpenCV to identify 
GUI components and can act on them with mouse and keyboard actions.
This is handy in cases when there is no easy access to a GUI's internals or 
the source code of the application or web page you want to act on. [More details](http://sikulix.com)

Great thanks for the new logo and all the help with the new webpage to [@Waleed Sadek](https://github.com/waleedsadek-panx)

**2.0.6 (branch release_2.0.x) preparing for release - snapshots available**

Direct IDE downloads &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[> for Windows <](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=com.sikulix&a=sikulixidewin&v=2.0.6-SNAPSHOT&e=jar) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[> for macOS Intel <](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=com.sikulix&a=sikulixidewin&v=2.0.6-SNAPSHOT&e=jar)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [> for macOS M1 <](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=com.sikulix&a=sikulixidemacm1&v=2.0.6-SNAPSHOT&e=jar)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [> for Linux <](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=com.sikulix&a=sikulixidelux&v=2.0.6-SNAPSHOT&e=jar) 

You get files like `sikulixidemac-2.0.6-20210708.194940-1.jar`, which you can place wherever you want and rename them to whatever you want. It is recommended to run with Java 11+ (preferably from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net) or [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#download-openjdk)) from a commandline/Terminal. 

**Be aware:** 
- Java 8 is no longer supported. 
- For macOS M1 (non-Intel) use the JDK's from [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk)

[more information coming soon]()

**Java: must be Java 11 or later** (best places to get it: [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net) or [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#download-openjdk))
- non-LTS versions like Java 16 or even 17ea might create problems that should be reported
- for macOS M1 (non-Intel) use the JDK's from [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk)

**Windows:** Works out of the box

**macOS/Linux** you have to make Tesseract OCR available ([for HowTo look here](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1/wiki/macOS-Linux:-Support-libraries-for-Tess4J-Tesseract-4-OCR)).

**Linux** OpenCV ibraries are bundled and should work on Ubuntu-like flavors. In case of problems you have to find a solutiuon.

<hr>

**Latest stable version is 2.0.5** (still runs with Java 8)

[Important: Read about changes/issues/enhancements](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX1/wiki/About-actual-release-version)

#### Contributions are welcome and appreciated
 - for `bugreports and requests for features or enhancements` use the issue tracker here
 - for `bugfixes` related to the latest release version you should create a pull request against the release branch (currently `release_2.0.x`), so your fix will be in the next bug-fix release (see milestones).
- for `smaller bugfixes and/or feature enhancements` related to the running development (currently branch master as version 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT and dev_... branches) you should create a pull request against the target branch
- a pull request should target only one branch. It is the resposibility and job of the maintainer to apply the changes to other branches in case 
- for `more complex revisions and/or enhancements` you should ask for a development branch together with a short description of your ideas
 
 **Please respect the following rules and guidelines when contributing**
  - Start with smaller fixes. E.g. choose an issue from the issue tracker and try to fix it. Or fix issues you encounter while using SikuliX.
  - Only fix cosmetic stuff if it's related to an issue you want to fix.
  - Before you change stuff like dependencies / overall code style and so on, talk with the maintainer beforehand.<br>Sometimes there is a a reason that things are as they are (... and sometimes not :-)).
  - Try to accept the individual coding styles of the acting contributors, even if some of the stuff might be sub-optimal in your eyes.<br>But feel free to talk about your ideas and the reasons behind.
