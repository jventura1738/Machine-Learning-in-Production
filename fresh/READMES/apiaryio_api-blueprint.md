# API Blueprint
### API Design for Humans

[![slack](https://apiblueprint-slack.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://apiblueprint-slack.herokuapp.com/)

A powerful high-level API design language for web APIs.

API Blueprint is simple and accessible to everybody involved in the API design
lifecycle. Its syntax is concise yet expressive.

With API Blueprint you can quickly prototype and model APIs to be created or
describe already deployed mission-critical APIs. From a [car][tesla] to the
largest Content Distribution Network (CDN) in the world.

The API Blueprint is built to encourage dialogue and collaboration between
project stakeholders, developers and customers at any point in the API
lifecycle. At the same time, the API Blueprint [tools][] provide the support to
achieve the goals be it API development, governance or delivery.

## Getting started
All it takes to describe an endpoint of your API is to write:

```apib
# GET /message
+ Response 200 (text/plain)

        Hello World!
```

in your favorite plain text editor.

With this blueprint you can already get a [mock][], [documentation][] and
[test][] for your API before you even start coding.

To learn more about the API Blueprint syntax jump directly to the
[API Blueprint Tutorial][tutorial] or take a look at some [examples][].
