OpenStack Nova provides a cloud computing fabric controller, supporting a wide
variety of compute technologies, including: libvirt (KVM, Xen, LXC and more),
Hyper-V, VMware, OpenStack Ironic and PowerVM.

Use the following resources to learn more.

API
---

To learn how to use Nova's API, consult the documentation available online at:

- `Compute API Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/>`__
- `Compute API Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/>`__

For more information on OpenStack APIs, SDKs and CLIs in general, refer to:

- `OpenStack for App Developers <https://www.openstack.org/appdev/>`__
- `Development resources for OpenStack clouds
  <https://developer.openstack.org/>`__

Operators
---------

To learn how to deploy and configure OpenStack Nova, consult the documentation
available online at:

- `OpenStack Nova <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/>`__

In the unfortunate event that bugs are discovered, they should be reported to
the appropriate bug tracker. If you obtained the software from a 3rd party
operating system vendor, it is often wise to use their own bug tracker for
reporting problems. In all other cases use the master OpenStack bug tracker,
available at:

- `Bug Tracker <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova>`__

Developers
----------

For information on how to contribute to Nova, please see the contents of the
CONTRIBUTING.rst.

Any new code must follow the development guidelines detailed in the HACKING.rst
file, and pass all unit tests.

Further developer focused documentation is available at:

- `Official Nova Documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/nova/>`__
- `Official Client Documentation
  <https://docs.openstack.org/python-novaclient/>`__

Other Information
-----------------

During each `Summit`_ and `Project Team Gathering`_, we agree on what the whole
community wants to focus on for the upcoming release. The plans for nova can
