## Books

More than any other field, management is full of fluffy books that could be summarized in one 100-word article. That being said, there's a number of excellent books, listed below.

### Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders

📖 [Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404) is hands down my preferred management book.

This book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient.

It provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of **deliberate action**. There's a also [a presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/micrimson/turn-the-ship-around-041614) that talks about the main concepts the author developed.

There are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them. The narration is great as well and the explanations are short, and to the point.

You can find a short summary in video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psAXMqxwol8)

> “Control without competence is chaos.”

— L. David Marquet, Turn the Ship Around!

### Other generalist books

- 📖 [The Advantage, Enhanced Edition: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ORWT3Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1), Patrick M. Lencioni.
  - The only way for people to embrace a message is to hear it over a period of time, in a variety of different situations, and preferably from different people. That’s why great leaders see themselves as Chief Reminding Officers as much as anything else.
  - The best way to do cascading communication is face-to-face and live. Seeing a leader and hearing the tone of his or her voice is critical for employees, as is being able to ask a question or two.
  - But then again, most organizations are unhealthy precisely because they aren’t doing the basic things, which require discipline, persistence, and follow-through more than sophistication or intelligence.
- 📖 [Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1484221575): "Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp’s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose."
- 📖 Oren Ellenbogen, [Leading Snowflakes: the Engineering Manager Handbook](http://leadingsnowflakes.com/): some truly great content and concrete ideas to move from maker to manager mode, code reviewing your management decisions, delegating tasks without losing quality or visibility.
- 📖 Adam Grant, [Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFPTSI0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1): "This gem is a joy to read, and it shatters the myth that greed is the path to success.", Robert Sutton.
- 📖 Ken Blanchard, [Lead Like Jesus: Lessons from the Greatest Leadership Role Model of All Time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VF62IO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).
- 📖 Andrew S. Grove, [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015VACHOK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). A landmark book by Intel CEO Andy Grove. Introduced many of the management best practices such as 1-1, OKR.
  - Managerial leverage measures the impact of what managers do to increase the output of their teams.
  - You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.
  - Every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you’re responsible for.
  - A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible.
  - A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity).
  - A manager’s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.
  - League standings are kept by team, not by individual. Business—and this means not just the business of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the business of medicine—is a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win.
  - Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager’s life.
  - The lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization.
  - Delegation without follow-through is abdication.
  - Any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it.
  - Self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled.
  - A successful MBO [management by objective] system needs only to answer two questions: 1.  Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2.  How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results).
  - The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say “no”—in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize—and act on the realization—that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say “yes” to and what we say “no” to—which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work.
  - Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, “Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.” Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.
  - I would like to propose Grove’s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.
  - When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.
  - That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience.
  - When the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement.
  - The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external.
  - At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential.
  - A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in.
- 📖 Patrick Lencioni, [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1500281191&sr=1-1&keywords=dysfunctions).
- 📖 Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead, Laszlo Bock. A pretty interesting description of Google's processes. A bit long at times.
- 📖 [The Manager's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/) , Camille Fournier. A very practical book with lots of down-to-earth advices.

## Engineering Management Topics

This is a list of inspiring articles related to engineering management. Those are usually short and concise articles that are packed with inspiring and concrete ideas. They have shaped my own management practice, and I hope they will inspire you as well.

I don't necessarily agree with everything listed here. Actually, you'll see that some of those articles have diametrically opposed opinions. I do believe those thought-provoking resources will help you in your manager journey.

- [Principles for Decision-Making in a Flat Organization](https://doist.com/blog/decision-making-flat-organization/)
  - We risk more when we delay decisions in an attempt to reach total consensus.
  - If there is a good enough solution X, don’t ask people what they think about it. Instead, ask everyone if they can live with it and if not, why.
  - Consensus is the path, not the destination.

> Arguments you should avoid using- that are logical fallacies “Because it’s always been done this way.” “Because we tried it before, and it didn’t work.” “Because company X uses this.” “Because {important person} said so.” Reason on tradeoffs, constraints, opportunities instead. Gergely Orosz

  - You won’t code anymore.
  - Management forces you to care more about everything.
  - Management creates an unavoidable power hierarchy.
  - You need to be technical enough to intervene.
  - Companies ultimately succeed or fail by their coordinated execution, culture and leadership.

### First days on the job

- Will Larson, [Your first 90 days as CTO or VP Engineering.](https://lethain.com/first-ninety-days-cto-vpe/)
  - Durable improvements depend on creating systems that create changes, not performing tactical actions that create the ephemeral appearance of improvement.
  - Figure out if something is really wrong and needs immediate attention.
  - Shadow customer meetings, partner meetings or user testing.
  - Find your business analytics and how to query them.
  - Shadow existing interviews, onboarding and closing calls.
  - Kickoff engineering brand efforts.
  - Build a trivial change and deploy it.

  - So the first step to achieving the results we really want is to fix the problem of believing that others are the source of all that ails us. It’s our dogmatic conviction that “if we could just fix those losers, all would go better” that keeps us from taking action that could lead to dialogue and progress. Which is why it’s no surprise that those who are best at dialogue tend to turn this logic around. They believe the best way to work on “us” is to start with “me.”
  - Respect is like air. As long as it’s present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it’s all that people can think about.
  - “One dull pencil is worth six sharp minds.” Don’t leave your hard work to memory. If you’ve gone to the effort to complete a crucial conversation, don’t fritter away all the meaning you created by trusting your memories. Write down the details of conclusions, decisions, and assignments.

### Hiring

#### General

- 📖 [Hiring The Best Knowledge Workers, Techies & Nerds: The Secrets & Science Of Hiring Technical People](https://www.amazon.com/Hiring-Knowledge-Workers-Techies-Nerds/dp/0932633595), Johanna Rothman. A solution-oriented book.
  - Train your interview team to apply a limited-consensus approach to hiring. When groups use limited consensus, not everyone may agree with the decision, but each person should be satisfied enough with a particular candidate’s suitability not to block the decision to hire him or her.
  - What if the vetoer is someone I don’t want to keep in the organization?” The answer to this is simple: In the interview process, only involve employees whose work you respect and value. If an employee isn’t successful in his or her technical position, don’t make that employee part of the interview team.
  - Make sure members of your team interview an internal candidate the same way they would interview an external candidate.
  - Know why you’re hiring more people. Define your problems to define your hiring strategy.
  - Sometimes, the main reason a hiring manager doesn’t hire a candidate is that he or she has a gut feeling that the person just won’t fit well with the culture. But a “gut feeling” is not a good reason not to hire someone, so train yourself to articulate culture-fit differences.
  - I personally do not consider certification to mean anything much when I am hiring someone for a technical position. Because the knowledge tested is functional-skills book knowledge, make sure you understand what the person must do to maintain his or her certification and the value of that certification to your environment.
  - Too often, internal recruiters look for tool and technology expertise or for advanced academic degrees, rather than for functional skill or for product-domain experience.
  - If you feel the need to take notes, take them on paper, never on a computer. My reason for this is that when you use a computer, you have to sit behind a screen, which creates a barrier between you and the candidate.
  - Promising an unconditional promotion is not just risky; it is stupid. Circumstances within the company can change; the employee may not perform up to expectations; the economy may tank.

#### Hiring: quotes

> If you can 'hire tough,' you can 'manage easy'.

Sue Tetzlaff, The Employee Experience: A Capstone Guide to Peak Performance

> I am convinced that nothing we do is more important than hiring and developing people. At the end of the day you bet on people, not on strategies.

Lawrence Bossidy, GE

> I hire people brighter than me and then I get out of their way.

Lee Iacocca, Ford

> You can dream, create, design and build the most wonderful place in the world... but it requires people to make the dream a reality.

Walt Disney

> Hire character. Train skill.

Peter Schutz, Porsche

> In technology, it's about the people. Getting the best people, retaining them, nurturing a creative environment, and helping to find a way to innovate.

Marissa Mayer

> I'd rather interview 50 people and not hire anyone than hire the wrong person.

Jeff Bezos

> Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.

Michael Jordan, American former professional basketball player

> Often the best solution to a management problem is the right person.

Edwin Booz

> Somebody once said that in looking for people to hire, you look for three qualities: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And if you don't have the first, the other two will kill you. You think about it; it's true. If you hire somebody without [integrity], you really want them to be dumb and lazy.

Warren Buffet

> One cannot hire a hand; the whole man always comes with it.

Peter Drucker

> If you think it's expensive to hire a professional to do the job, wait until you hire an amateur.

  - Your first responsibility as a manager is to manage yourself: your integrity, character, ethics, knowledge, wisdom, temperament, words and acts.
  - The second responsibility is to manage those who have authority over us.
  - The third responsibility is to manage your peers: without their respect and confidence, nothing can be accomplished.
  - The fourth responsibility is to manage those whom we have authority.
  - You can't manage your bosses, peers, regulators etc. But you can understand them, motivate them, influence them, forgive them.
  - "It is from failure that amazing growth and grace so often come, provided only that one can recognise it, admit it, learn from it, rise above it, and try again. True leadership presumes a standard quite beyond human perfectibility and that is quite alright, for joy and satisfaction are in the pursuit of an objective, not in its realization."

  - Good managers are skilled at asking questions that give their team members a new perspective on the problem and reach the right solution on their own.
  - Good managers address context first, then content.
  - Good managers know that, above all else, they are agents of their company. Their default mode is to make and facilitate company-optimal choices.
  - Good managers know that fixing broader company culture is an important part of their role as a designated leader within the company.
  - Good managers understand that the long game is all about people.
  - Good managers don’t have just one go-to management style nor do they have a notion of “THE ideal employee”.
  - Good managers can discern good intent from bad.

### Organization structure

- Martin Casado, [Hire a VP of Engineering](https://a16z.com/2017/05/26/hiring-vp-engineering-why-what/) on the Andreessen Horowitz blog
  - The most important function of a VP of engineering is to build out the engineering team and set a startup’s engineering culture.
  - Competent engineering management should therefore be able to push the team towards more practical, incremental designs that can garner useful external feedback quickly — without compromising the long-term generality of the system. The VP’s role here is not producing the architecture, but ensuring that incremental release is a real requirement in the design process.
  - Strong engineering management tends to give their teams enough ownership and latitude that they are happy and fulfilled in driving the product forward.

  - Engineering managers in this model had little responsibility beyond the career development of the people they managed.
  - There was no single person accountable for the engineering team’s delivery or who could negotiate prioritization of work at an equivalent level of responsibility.
  - Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want.
  - Business units, departments, teams, and managers more effectively communicate organization structure roles and responsibilities than Spotify’s synonyms and are not attached to a way of working that failed their creator.
- [Independence,autonomy,too many small teams](https://kislayverma.com/organizations/independence-autonomy-and-too-many-small-teams/)
  - Every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself, without a lot of overlap with other teams.
  - The team should be able to meets its goals independently (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams).
  - Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team.

  - There should be no shared ownership of components, libraries, or code.
  - If you have microservices but are still waiting to do end-to-end testing of a combination of services, you have a distributed monolith (a distributed monolith is when all changes in a service require updates to other services).
  - Use software boundaries defined by business-domain bounded contexts
  - Teams composed of only people with single functional expertise should be avoided at all costs.
  - Four fundamental team topologies: stream-aligned, enabling, complicated subsystem, platform.

### Production and productivity

- [The Toyota Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way), Wikipedia
  - Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals.
  - Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface.
  - Use "pull" systems to avoid overproduction.
  - Level out the workload
  - Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time
  - Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.
  - Use visual control so no problems are hidden.
  - Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes.
  - Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others.
  - Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy.
  - Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.
  - Go and see for yourself to thoroughly understand the situation
  - Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options; implement decisions rapidly
  - Become a learning organization through relentless reflection (hansei) and continuous improvement (kaizen)

### Personal productivity

- [Makers, Don't Let Yourself Be Forced Into the 'Manager Schedule'](https://blog.nuclino.com/makers-don-t-let-yourself-be-forced-into-the-manager-schedule)
  - Research shows that it takes as long as 30 minutes for makers to get into the flow
  - Use maker-manager office hours
  - Communication can happen at a quieter asynchronous frequency in the form of thoughtful, written discussions rather than soul-sucking meetings or erratic one-line-at-a-time chat messages
  - Build a team knowledge base to minimize repetitive questions and allow self-onboarding.
- 🎧 [How to Change Your Behavior](https://coachingforleaders.com/podcast/change-your-behavior-bj-fogg/), Coaching for Leaders
  - It’s a myth that it takes 21 or 66 days to create a habit. Repetition doesn't create habits. Emotions create habits.
  - Create a tiny habit through an ABC process: anchor moment, a tiny behavior, and instant celebration.
  - Avoid raising the bar on the tiny behavior. Do more if you want to, but don’t change the standard.

In terms of software, I can't recommend [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) enough (Mac and iOS only). It is a delightful piece of software that gets out of the way and lets you focus on your tasks.

  - With constant innovation, new market entrants and potential black swans like a global pandemic, the best a leader can do is set a 12–18 month strategic plan that is directionally aligned with the company’s true north. That plan should be broken down by quarter with the assumption that the degree of confidence in achieving goals within each quarter will decline over time.
  - Expect each team across the organization to cascade their operational roadmaps from these strategic foci. Operational roadmaps should identify key initiatives and milestones.

### Project management

- 📖 [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) by Frederick Brooks is a classical book about software project management.
    - Now I do not think software managers have less inherent courage and firmness than chefs, nor than other engineering managers. But false scheduling to match the patron's desired date is much more common in our discipline than elsewhere in engineering.
    - The boss must first distinguish between action information and status information. He must discipline himself not to act on problems his managers can solve.
- Jason Yip, [It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html): standup are a pretty controversial topics. This article on Martin Fowler's blog provides a good list of patterns and anti-patterns to ensure they're a good productive use of everybody's time.

- [Who are you trying to impress with your deadlines?](http://jatins.gitlab.io/me/why-deadline/)
    - Deadlines set wrong expectations for what's good
    - People are going to cut corners if you put them to tough deadlines.
    - No one is going to experiment with new ways of doing things if you fetishize finishing under deadlines. We'd still be doing MVC in frontend apps if someone at Facebook didn't miss a deadline.
    - Have deadlines, but fuzzy. How fuzzy should be decided by your goals. If missing a deadline could potentially lose you a million dollars, the fuzziness factor for that should be zero.

### Team vision

"Starting with the why" is one of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People's best chapters.

- Seth Godin, [A manifesto for small teams doing important work](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/a-manifesto-for-small-teams-doing-important-work.html): really inspiring list of short cultural values for a team. Craft your own!
- Seth Godin, [Big questions before little ones](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/03/big-questions-before-little-ones.html)
- 🎞 [Focusing is about saying no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8eP99neOVs) (Steve Jobs)
- 🎞 [Vision is about perseverance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFE-Tdz24hM) (Steve Jobs)
- 🎞 Bryan Cantrill (Joyent VP of Eng) about the [importance of why](https://youtu.be/1KeYzjILqDo?t=649).
  - The primary motivator is mission and purpose. Software development is about delivering utility to humanity.
  - The soul is what motivates. You need to be able to explain the "why".
- 🎞 Steve Jobs on the [same topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JayWnYq9zks).
  - Focus on the gems.
- 🎞 [Start with why](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en), TED talk by Simon Sinek.
- 🎤 [Insist on Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?index=9&list=PL__mLVkEYIvwv61O6ohmAv2rE2X8ScP7b&v=fcohHIJr6Ns&ab_channel=Nugget), Keith Rabois
  - The reason why this [forcing people to focus and work on only one important problem] was such a successful strategy is that most people tend to substitute from A+ problems that are very difficult to solve to B+ problems for which they already know a solution to.

### Technical strategy

- [Letter to Shareholders](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312517120198/d373368dex991.htm), Jeff Bezos: “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.” So much is packed in this letter. Day 1 is about true customer obsession, resisting proxies, embracing external trends, high-velocity decision making.
- [5 Red Flags Signaling Your Rebuild Will Fail](https://www.pkc.io/blog/five-red-flags-signaling-your-rebuild-will-fail/)
- [Polyglot programming in startup environments](https://medium.com/@FarisZacina/polyglot-startup-environments-1211b93615d5)
    - Never introduce a new programming language in an existing code-base because of personal preference. Building software is a team effort. Globalize your code languages. Team cohesion is what matters the most.
    - You must have production experience in the programming language you want to replace or complement with another one
    - A decision to introduce a new programming language must be based on non-functional requirements, measurements or other relevant arguments, and not personal opinions.
    - Always think about the team and company, and especially about hiring and expanding the team.
    - A programming language is just a tool to deliver software. Don’t be in a tight relationship with your screwdriver.

Shameless plug here, two presentations I contributed to:

- 🎤 [Amazon: the hidden empire](http://www.slideshare.net/faberNovel/amazoncom-the-hidden-empire)

- [Steve Jobs explaining why you should start from the customers, and go backward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-tKLISfPE) (video 🎞). He makes the point that stopping the OpenDoc project was the right thing to do because it was a technology without any customer.
- [Can Do Vs Must Do](http://avc.com/2017/05/can-do-vs-must-do/) , AVC. "Doing a startup is like playing a video game. Each level requires you to master one thing and once you do that, you level up and then there is a new thing to master."
- "Waterline principle" from Bill Gore: "Think of being on a ship, and imagine that any decision gone bad will blow a hole in the side of the ship. If you blow a hole above the waterline (where the ship won’t take on water and possibly sink), you can patch the hole, learn from the experience, and sail on. But if you blow a hole below the waterline, you can find yourself facing gushers of water pouring in, pulling you toward the ocean floor. And if it’s a big enough hole, you might go down really fast, just like some of the financial firm catastrophes of 2008. To be clear, great enterprises do make big bets, but they avoid big bets that could blow holes below the waterline.", How We Might Fall.
- [Write five, then synthesize: good engineering strategy is boring](https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/), Will Larson.

### Team dynamics

- [Shields Down](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/), Rands in Repose
  - Boredom in its many forms is a major contributor to resignations, but the truth is the list of contributing factors to shield weakening is immense.
  - Every moment as a leader is an opportunity to either strengthen or weaken shields.

### Training

- [Great developers are raised, not hired](https://sizovs.net/2019/04/10/the-best-developers-are-raised-not-hired/)
  - Take some money, energy, time that you spend on recruiting and invest it in teaching your best developers mentoring skills.
  - Adjust your interview process and give a chance to candidates that are not good enough yet, but are eager to learn and have a growth mindset.
  - Relax “hard requirements” in your job ads to avoid filtering out impostors.

### Work ethics & work/life balance

- [The Virtues of Laziness and Impatience](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2016/06/the-virtues-of-laziness-and-impatience.html): "there are two areas I encourage you to practice showing, right now: figuring out what’s important, and going home."
- [Lazy Leadership](https://medium.com/the-modern-team/lazy-leadership-8ba19e34f959#.bwcfjz5ac): "entrepreneurship is really just a fancy word for delegation".

### TV Shows

Netflix's [Chef's table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_Table) profiles a couple world-renown chef. The kitchen world bears a lot of similarities with management. In the season two, I especially recommend episode 1 and 3:

- [Alex Atala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Atala)'s story shows that you need to constantly reinvent and disrupt yourself.
- [Dominique Crenn](http://www.ateliercrenn.com/) explains how she was given ownership over her work in her first kitchen experience (where she was basically given just a dish name, a list of ingredients, and was expected to invent the recipe with no kitchen training). She replicated that in her own kitchen.

The Office is a great satire of a dysfunctioning office.

- [Tech People Leadership](http://newsletter.techpeopleleadership.com/) (Joe Dunn): Links, notes and opinions for leaders in the tech industry.

### Blogs

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/): mandatory if you want to stay abreast of what's going in tech. There are some good management articles from time to time as well. Since it can be a pretty huge time sink, I subscribe to a curation of the top articles instead ([RSS feed here](http://www.daemonology.net/hn-daily/index.rss)).

### Podcast

- [FRICTION with Bob Sutton](https://art19.com/shows/friction-with-bob-sutton?page=3). This podcast does not have any new episode since 2017, but it has some really great content. Great conversations. Lots of stories.
    - Part organizational design. Part therapy. Organizational psychologist and Stanford Professor Bob Sutton is back to tackle friction, the phenomenon that frustrates employees, fatigues teams and causes organizations to flounder and fail.
