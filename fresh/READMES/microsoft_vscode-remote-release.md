## Releases

VS Code Remote Development extension "stable" releases are tied directly to VS Code releases. Release highlights can be found in [VS Code release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) which will include a link to [detailed extension release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/main/remote-release-notes). 

The extensions are developed using the same [development process and schedule](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process#inside-an-iteration) as VS Code itself. You can see what is planned for the current development iteration in a pinned [planning issue in this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues). This issue will include a link to the broader VS Code plan. As with VS Code itself, the extensions will update during a development iteration with changes that are only available in [VS Code Insiders Edition](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).
