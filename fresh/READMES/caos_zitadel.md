## What Is ZITADEL

**ZITADEL** is a "Cloud Native Identity and Access Management" solution built for the cloud era. ZITADEL uses a modern software stack consisting of [**Golang**](https://golang.org/), [**Angular**](https://angular.io/) and  [**CockroachDB**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) as sole storage and follows an event sourced pattern.

We built **ZITADEL** not only with the vision of becoming a great open source project but also as a superb platform to support developers building their applications, without need to handle secure user login and account management themselves.

## How Does It Work

We built **ZITADEL** around the idea that the IAM should be easy to deploy and scale. That's why we tried to reduce external systems as much as possible.
For example, **ZITADEL** is event sourced but it does not rely on a pub/sub system to function. Instead we built all the functionality right into one binary.
**ZITADEL** only needs [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/) for orchestration and [**CockroachDB**](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) as storage.
