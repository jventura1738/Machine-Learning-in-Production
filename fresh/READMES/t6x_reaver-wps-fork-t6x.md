# Overview

**Reaver** implements a **brute force attack** against **Wifi Protected Setup** (WPS) registrar **PINs** in order to recover **WPA/WPA2 passphrases**, as described in [Brute forcing Wi-Fi Protected Setup When poor design meets poor implementation.](http://sviehb.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/viehboeck_wps.pdf) by **Stefan Viehböck**.  
**Reaver** has been designed to be a robust and practical attack against **Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)** registrar PINs in order to **recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases** and has been tested against a wide variety of access points and WPS implementations.  
**Depending on the target's Access Point (AP)**, to recover the plain text WPA/WPA2 passphrase the **average** amount of time for the transitional **online brute force** method is **between 4-10 hours**. In practice, it will generally take half this time to guess the correct WPS pin and recover the passphrase.
When using the **offline attack**, **if** the AP is vulnerable, it may take only a matter of **seconds to minutes**.

The first version of **reaver-wps** (reaver 1.0) was created by **Craig Heffner** in 2011.   
**reaver-wps-fork-t6x** version **1.6.x** is a **community forked version** which includes **various bug fixes**, **new features** and additional attack method (such as the **offline Pixie Dust** attack).

* The original Reaver (version 1.0 to 1.4) can be found in [google code archives](https://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/).
* The discontinued reaver-wps-fork-t6x community edition, reaver version 1.5.3, which includes the Pixie Dust attack, is now the  [old-master branch](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/tree/master-old) from this repository.  
* The latest revison of reaver-wps-fork-t6x community edition is the [master branch](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x)  from this repository.  
Reaver versioning was updated to **1.6.x** in order to identify the new cycle.  
All stable relases since the first beta version of reaver 1.6 can be downloaded from our [Releases](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/releases) page.  
* More information about the Pixie Dust attack (including **which APs are vulnerable**) can be found in [pixiewps repository](https://github.com/wiire/pixiewps),

# Requirements  

## Build-time dependencies

 - libpcap-dev  
 - build-essential  

## Runtime-time dependencies  

 - pixiewps (optional, required for pixiedust attack)  
 - aircrack-ng (optional, though recommended)  

## Example 
```
sudo apt -y install build-essential libpcap-dev aircrack-ng pixiewps
```
_The example uses [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) as the Operating System (OS) as `pixiewps` is included._

You **must** already have Wiire's Pixiewps installed to perform a pixie dust attack, latest version can be found in its [official github repository](https://github.com/wiire/pixiewps).

Options description and examples of use can be found in the [Readme from Craig Heffner](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/blob/master/docs/README.REAVER). Here comes a description of the new options introduced since then:  
## -K or -Z  // --pixie-dust 
The `-K` and `-Z` option perform the offline attack, Pixie Dust _(`pixiewps`)_, by automatically passing the **PKE**, **PKR**, **E-Hash1**, **E-Hash2**, **E-Nonce** and **Authkey** variables. `pixiewps` will then try to attack **Ralink**, **Broadcom** and **Realtek** detected chipset.
**Special note**: If you are attacking a **Realtek AP**, **do NOT** use small DH Keys (`-S`) option.
User will have to execute reaver with the cracked PIN (option -p) to get the WPA pass-phrase. 
This is a temporary solution and an option to do a full attack will be implemented soon
## -p with arbitrary string // --pin=<wps pin>  
See our wiki: [Introducing a new way to crack WPS: Option p with an Arbitrary String](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/wiki/Introducing-a-new-way-to-crack-WPS:-Option--p-with-an-Arbitrary-String)

A detailed description of the options with  concrete syntax examples can be found in [Craig Heffner's wash readme](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/blob/master/docs/README.WASH).  
About the new options and features: 
## -a  //  --all  
The option `-a` of Wash will list all access points, including those without WPS enabled.  
## -j  //  --json  
The extended WPS information (serial, model...) from the AP probe answer will be printed in the terminal (in json format)  
## "Vendor" column  
Wash now displays the manufacturer of the wifi chipset from the Acces Points in order to know if they are vulnerable to pixie dust attack.  
## Stdout can be piped  
Notice that wash output can be piped into other commands. For more information see the wiki article [Everything about the new options from wash](https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x/wiki/Everything-about-the-new-options-from-wash)
