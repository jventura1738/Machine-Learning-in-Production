# Important before you get started.
This package is provided as-is. I simply don't have the time anymore to do further work on it. Other projects are taking up my time, which means this one is slowly falling below the radar. However, I'll gladly look at PRs for fixes and feature improvements though. It is open-source after all. A lot of the features this added are currently also available in Xamarin.Forms, so seeing as how that will be supported for some time to come I would advise slowly making the transition. So, with that being said, I do want to thank everyone who’s supported the package over the last few years. The fact that so many people have been using it amazes me to this day, as that was definitely not what I expected when I set out making it ❤️

## Why PancakeView?

In a lot of Xamarin.Forms UI work I do I have the need for a layout/view that I can use that supports gradients, borders, rounded corners and shadows. Since none of the existing Xamarin.Forms controls fit the bill I decided to roll my own. And why is it called a ```PancakeView``` you ask? Well, pancakes are also round, have shadows and have a glorious gradient color. What better fit can you think of?
