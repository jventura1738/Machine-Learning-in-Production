## About The Project

**How it started:**

Gamestonk Terminal is an awesome stock and crypto market terminal that has been developed for fun, while I saw my GME shares tanking. But hey, I like the stock 💎🙌.

**How it's going:**

Gamestonk Terminal provides a modern Python-based integrated environment for investment research, that allows the average joe retail trader to leverage state-of-the-art Data Science and Machine Learning technologies.

As a modern Python-based environment, GamestonkTerminal opens access to numerous Python data libraries in Data Science (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Jupyter), Machine Learning (Pytorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Flair), and Data Acquisition (Beautiful Soup, and numerous third-party APIs).

## Donation

Gamestonk Terminal is a free Open-Source Software. This means that the entire codebase is public, and any user can use it for free.

A small team of us are consistently working to provide as many updates to the project as we can, and this is done out of hours, often late nights to improve this tool. Whilst we don't earn any money from Gamestonk Terminal, we want to make sure that all our users can make the best investments from our software. As we continue to build on this project, we would really appreciate any type of donation or support so we can buy more coffees to fuel us even more!

Here's our Patreon page: https://www.patreon.com/gamestonkterminal

There are many ways to help support GST. If you want to help, non-monetarily, join our [discord](https://discord.gg/Up2QGbMKHY). Sharing the terminal with friends would also go a long way. Thanks in advance ape.

## Getting Started

### Install

If you'd like to see a video recording of the installation process, @JohnnyDankseed has made one available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DJJ-cfquDA).

The user @mchow01 has made available a tutorial on [how to run the terminal on an Apple M1](https://mchow01.github.io/macos/system/gamestonk/2021/05/27/gamestonk-terminal-m1.html).

This project supports Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.

Our current recommendation is to use this project with Anaconda's Python distribution - either full [__Anaconda3 Latest__](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/) or [__Miniconda3 Latest__](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/). Several features in this project utilize Machine Learning. Machine Learning Python dependencies are optional. If you decided to add Machine Learning features at a later point, you will likely have better user experience with Anaconda's Python distribution.

0. Star the project
<img width="1272" alt="Captura de ecrã 2021-04-25, às 01 13 30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25267873/115989986-e20cfe80-a5b8-11eb-8182-d6d87d092252.png">

1. [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) (It's on the AUR as anaconda or miniconda3!)

Confirm that you have it with: `conda -V`. The output should be something along the lines of: `conda 4.9.2`

- If on Windows, install/update Microsoft C++ Build Tools from here: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

2. Install git

```
conda install -c anaconda git
````

3. Clone the Project

  - Via HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal.git`
  - via SSH:  `git clone git@github.com:GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal.git`

4. Navigate into the project's folder

```
cd GamestonkTerminal/
```

5. Create Environment

You can name the environment whatever you want. Although you could use names such as: `welikethestock`, `thisistheway` or `diamondhands`, we recommend something simple and intuitive like `gst`. This is because this name will be used from now onwards.

```
conda env create -n gst --file build/conda/conda-3-8-env.yaml
````

6. Activate the virtual environment

```
conda activate gst
```

Note: At the end, you can deactivate it with: `conda deactivate`.

7. Install poetry dependencies

```
poetry install
```

If you are having trouble with Poetry (e.g. on a Windows system), simply install requirements.txt with pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

8.  You're ready to Gamestonk it!

```
python terminal.py
```

9. (Windows - Optional) Speeding up opening process in the future

After you've installed Gamestonk Terminal, you'll find a file named "Gamestonk Terminal.bat". You can use this file to open Gamestonk Terminal quicker. This file can be moved to your desktop if you'd like. If you run into issues while trying to run the batch file. If you run into issues with the batch files, edit the file and check to see if the directories match up. This file assumes you used the default directories when installing.

**NOTE:** When you close the terminal and re-open it, the only command you need to re-call is `conda activate gst` before you call `python terminal.py` again.

**TROUBLESHOOT:** If you are having troubles to install, check our *newest* <a href="https://github.com/GamestonkTerminal/GamestonkTerminal/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOT.md"><strong>troubleshoot page</strong></a>

### Advanced User Install - Machine Learning

If you are an advanced user and use other Python distributions, we have several requirements.txt documents that you can pick from to download project dependencies.

If you are using conda instead of build/conda/conda-3-8-env.yaml configuration file in Step 5, use build/conda/conda-3-8-env-full.

Note: The libraries specified in the [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file have been tested and work for the purpose of this project, however, these may be older versions. Hence, it is recommended for the user to set up a virtual python environment prior to installing these. This allows to keep dependencies required by different projects in separate places.

*If you would like to use optional Machine Learning features:*

* Update your [feature_flags.py](/gamestonk_terminal/feature_flags.py) with:
```
ENABLE_PREDICT = os.getenv("GTFF_ENABLE_PREDICT") or True
```

* Install optional ML features dependencies:
```
poetry install -E prediction
```

*If you would like to set up a docker image:*

* Build the docker: `docker build .`
* Run it: `docker run -it gamestonkterminal:dev `

Note: The problem with docker is that it won't output matplotlib figures.

### Update Terminal

The terminal is constantly being updated with new features and bug fixes, hence, for your terminal to be update, you can run:
```
git pull
```
to get the latest changes.

If this fails due to the fact that you had modified some python files, and there's a conflict with the updates, you can use:
```
git stash
```

Then, re-run `poetry install` or  `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get any new dependencies.

Once installation is finished, you're ready to gamestonk.

If you `stashed` your changes previously, you can un-stash them with:
```
git stash pop
```

### API Keys

The project is build around several different API calls, whether it is to access historical data or financials.

These are the ones where a key is necessary:
* Alpha Vantage: https://www.alphavantage.co
* Binance: https://binance.us (US) / https://binance.com (Outside US)
* CoinMarketCap API: https://coinmarketcap.com/api
* Degiro API : https://www.degiro.fr
* FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
* Financial Modeling Prep: https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer
* Finhub API: https://finnhub.io
* News API: https://newsapi.org
* Oanda API: https://developer.oanda.com
* Polygon: https://polygon.io
* Quandl: https://www.quandl.com/tools/api
* Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
* Tradier: https://developer.tradier.com/getting_started
* Twitter: https://developer.twitter.com

When these are obtained, don't forget to update [config_terminal.py](/gamestonk_terminal/config_terminal.py).

Alternatively, you can also set them to the following environment variables:

| Website | Variables |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co) | GT_API_KEY_ALPHAVANTAGE |
| [Binance](https://binance.com) | GT_API_BINANCE_KEY <br/> GT_API_BINANCE_SECRET |
| [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) | GT_CMC_API_KEY <br/> GT_CMC_API_KEY |
| [DEGIRO](https://www.degiro.fr) | GT_DG_USERNAME <br/> GT_DG_PASSWORD <br/> GT_DG_TOTP_SECRET |
| [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) | GT_API_FRED_KEY |
| [Financial Modeling Prep](https://financialmodelingprep.com) | GT_API_KEY_FINANCIALMODELINGPREP |
| [Finhub](https://finnhub.io) | GT_API_FINNHUB_KEY |
| [News](https://newsapi.org) | GT_API_NEWS_TOKEN |
| [Oanda](https://developer.oanda.com) | GT_OANDA_TOKEN <br/> GT_OANDA_ACCOUNT |
| [Polygon](https://polygon.io) | GT_API_POLYGON_KEY |
| [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com) | GT_API_KEY_QUANDL |
| [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) | GT_API_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID <br> GT_API_REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET <br/> GT_API_REDDIT_USERNAME <br/> GT_API_REDDIT_USER_AGENT <br/> GT_API_REDDIT_PASSWORD|
| [Tradier](https://developer.tradier.com) | GT_TRADIER_TOKEN |
| [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com) | GT_API_TWITTER_KEY <br/> GT_API_TWITTER_SECRET_KEY <br/> GT_API_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN |

Example:
```
export GT_API_REDDIT_USERNAME=SexyYear
```

Environment variables can also be set in a `.env` file at the top of the repo. This file is ignored by git so your API keys will stay secret. The above example stored in `.env` would be:
```
GT_API_REDDIT_USERNAME=SexyYear
```

Note that the `GT_API_REDDIT_USER_AGENT` is the name of the script that you set when obtained the Reddit API key.
Note that it is not necessary to have a valid Alpha Vantage key to get daily OHLC values.

### Usage

Start by loading a ticker of interest:
```
load -t GME
```
The menu will expand to all its menus since a ticker has been loaded.

View the historical data of this stock:
```
view
```
Slice the historical data by loading ticker and setting a starting point, e.g.
```
load -t GME -s 2020-06-04
```
Enter in technical analysis menu with
```
ta
```
and run a SMA with:
```
sma
```
However, imagine that you wanted to change the length of the window because you don't want to go long but do a swing, and therefore a smaller window is necessary. Check what settings are available on the SMA command:
```
sma -h
```
Once that has been seen, set the parameters that you want after flagging them. In this case, to change length window to 10, we would have to do:
```
sma -l 10
```
