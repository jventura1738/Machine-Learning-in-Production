# Postman App Support

If you have a feature request, a new integration idea or you would like to file a bug report, please use this [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues). 

We _recommend_ that you search the issue tracker to check if someone else has already reported the issue and whether there is a known solution that you can use. This would be the fastest way for you to find a solution to any issue that you are currently facing.

If you are adding a bug report, please add detailed steps to reproduce the bug, the Postman version you're using, and your OS version. Any additional files (collections, data dumps, console errors, screenshots) would be very helpful and would help us to narrow down the issue as quickly as possible. 

We have compiled a quick set of [guidelines for reporting issues](#guidelines-for-reporting-issues).

> **Account Specific Queries:**<br />
> If you have any billing or account-specific queries, reach out to us by submitting a ticket on our [support page](https://www.postman.com/support/).

We are also there as [@getpostman](https://www.twitter.com/getpostman) on Twitter. Feel free to drop in a line wherever it is easiest for you. Twitter would be the best place for you to stay updated with the latest news, features, and releases regarding Postman.

## Guidelines for reporting issues

We have put together a short set of guidelines you can follow while adding an issue to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues). Following this should help speedy resolution of issues.

1. This issue tracker is only for Postman App related issues, along with other services accessible from the app.
  If you have Newman specific issues, a better place to report them would be the Newman issue tracker at [https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/issues](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/issues)

2. If you are facing a Postman Cloud-related issue (such as sync, cloud-api, documenter, etc) and you want to include personal information such as your username or collection names, reach out to us by submitting a ticket on our [support page](https://www.postman.com/support/).

3. If you want to report a security issue in any of Postman’s services or products, read our [security reporting guidelines and policy](https://www.postman.com/vulnerability-reporting) for more details.

4. Answer to questions along the lines of "How do I... in Postman" should be in our online documentation at [https://learning.postman.com/](https://learning.postman.com/). If you are unable to find a how-to guide in our online documentation, feel free to ask your question on our [Postman Community Forum](https://community.postman.com).

5. Before reporting an issue use the search feature on the issues page to check if there are issues similar to yours. A lot of issues are duplicates, and it is hard to keep track of them or respond when the issues are solved. If you find your issue already reported, feel free to add a "thumbs up" reaction and we will keep a note of it.

6. When reporting a new issue in the issue tracker, check whether it helps to answer the following questions:

   - Which Postman App and Operating System version you are using. You can check this out in _Settings -> About_ section.

   - Is the bug reproducible every time, or do you see it occasionally?

   - Did you first encounter it recently, or has it always been there?

   - If it is a UI issue, a screenshot or GIF will help tremendously. (Tip: For quick gifs, check out [http://www.cockos.com/licecap/](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/))
   
   - If the issue is related to a script in the sandbox, attach the full code snippet and ensure that this is formatted correctly using the code block [markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) 

   - Do you have the [Postman Interceptor](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/capturing-http-requests/) switched on? (applicable for the Chrome app)

   - If the request/response flow is not working, be sure to check and include details from the DevTools window (More on this at [https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/debugging-and-logs/](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/debugging-and-logs/)).
