SQL Explorer
============

SQL Explorer aims to make the flow of data between people fast,
simple, and confusion-free. It is a Django-based application that you
can add to an existing Django site, or use as a standalone business
intelligence tool.

Quickly write and share SQL queries in a simple, usable SQL editor,
preview the results in the browser, share links, download CSV, JSON,
or Excel files (and even expose queries as API endpoints, if desired),
and keep the information flowing!

Comes with support for multiple connections, to many different SQL
database types, a schema explorer, query history (e.g. lightweight
version control), a basic security model, in-browser pivot tables, and
more.

SQL Explorer values simplicity, intuitive use, unobtrusiveness,
stability, and the principle of least surprise.

SQL Explorer is inspired by any number of great query and
reporting tools out there.

The original idea came from Stack Exchange's `Data Explorer
<http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/queries>`_, but also owes
credit to similar projects like `Redash <http://redash.io/>`_ and
`Blazer <https://github.com/ankane/blazer>`_.

You can read the full documentation `here <https://django-sql-explorer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
