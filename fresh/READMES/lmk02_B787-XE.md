## Boeing 787-XE - A Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 Mod
We have just started working on a mod for the Boeing 787-10. There is a lot of effort going into this mod. We are currently working on implementing all MFS Pages and improving the FMC. There is a lot more to come. We can't wait to improve the 787-10.

## Installation
Just download the latest release [here](https://github.com/lmk02/B787-XE/releases) and copy the inner "B787-XE" folder into your community folder of MSFS 2020.

## Features
### FMC
- Descent Forecast
- Vspeeds (iFarisKH)
- Takeoff Flaps (iFarisKH)
### MFD
- Door Page
- Gear Page
- Status Page
- Electrical Synoptic Display
- Flight Control Surfaces Page (mupok)
### HUD
- Colored Green (Ollie2304)
- ILS markers added (sbutters)

We can't offer much more right now because we just started working on it, but we are working on many different things.
