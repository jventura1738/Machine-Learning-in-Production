Security Monkey
===============

<img align="right" alt="Security Monkey Logo 2017" src="docs/images/Security_Monkey.png" width="50%">

Security Monkey monitors your [AWS and GCP accounts](https://medium.com/@Netflix_Techblog/netflix-security-monkey-on-google-cloud-platform-gcp-f221604c0cc7) for policy changes and alerts on insecure configurations.  Support is available for OpenStack public and private clouds.  Security Monkey can also watch and monitor your GitHub organizations, teams, and repositories.

It provides a single UI to browse and search through all of your accounts, regions, and cloud services.  The monkey remembers previous states and can show you exactly what changed, and when.

Security Monkey can be extended with [custom account types](docs/plugins.md), [custom watchers](docs/development.md#adding-a-watcher), [custom auditors](docs/development.md#adding-an-auditor), and [custom alerters](docs/misc.md#custom-alerters).

It works on CPython 2.7. It is known to work on Ubuntu Linux and OS X.
