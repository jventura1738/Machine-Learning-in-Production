Features
================================
* Supports __0.7__...__0.9.16__ (netty-socketio 1.6.6) and __1.0+__ (netty-socketio latest version) version of [Socket.IO-client](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client)  
* Supports xhr-polling transport  
* Supports websocket transport  
* Supports namespaces and rooms  
* Supports ack (acknowledgment of received data)  
* Supports SSL  
* Supports client store (Memory, [Redisson](https://redisson.org), [Hazelcast](https://www.hazelcast.com/))  
* Supports distributed broadcast across netty-socketio nodes ([Redisson](https://redisson.org), [Hazelcast](https://www.hazelcast.com/))  
* Supports OSGi  
* Supports Spring  
* Lock-free and thread-safe implementation  
* Declarative handler configuration via annotations  


Performance
================================

Customer feedback in __2012__:  
CentOS, 1 CPU, 4GB RAM runned on VM: 
CPU 10%, Memory 15%  
6000 xhr-long polling sessions or 15000 websockets sessions  
4000 messages per second  


Customer feedback in __2014__:  
"To stress test the solution we run 30 000 simultaneous websocket clients and managed to peak at total of about 140 000 messages per second with less than 1 second average delay." (c) Viktor Endersz - Kambi Sports Solutions
