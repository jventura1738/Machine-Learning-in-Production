Features and Updates
------------------------------------
Many thanks to George Berry, Ewan Klein, Pierpaolo Pantone for key contributions to make VADER better.  The new updates includes capabilities regarding:

#. Refactoring for Python 3 compatibility, improved modularity, and incorporation into `[NLTK] <http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html>`_ ...many thanks to Ewan & Pierpaolo.
#. Restructuring for much improved speed/performance, reducing the time complexity from something like O(N^4) to O(N)...many thanks to George.
#. Simplified pip install and better support for vaderSentiment module and component import. (Dependency on vader_lexicon.txt file now uses automated file location discovery so you don't need to manually designate its location in the code, or copy the file into your executing code's directory.)
#. More complete demo in the ``__main__`` for ``vaderSentiment.py``. The demo has:

	* examples of typical use cases for sentiment analysis, including proper handling of sentences with:

		- typical negations (e.g., "*not* good")
		- use of contractions as negations (e.g., "*wasn't* very good")
		- conventional use of **punctuation** to signal increased sentiment intensity (e.g., "Good!!!")
		- conventional use of **word-shape** to signal emphasis (e.g., using ALL CAPS for words/phrases)
		- using **degree modifiers** to alter sentiment intensity (e.g., intensity *boosters* such as "very" and intensity *dampeners* such as "kind of")
		- understanding many **sentiment-laden slang** words (e.g., 'sux')
		- understanding many sentiment-laden **slang words as modifiers** such as 'uber' or 'friggin' or 'kinda'
		- understanding many sentiment-laden **emoticons** such as :) and :D
		- translating **utf-8 encoded emojis** such as üíò and üíã and üòÅ
		- understanding sentiment-laden **initialisms and acronyms** (for example: 'lol')

	* more examples of **tricky sentences** that confuse other sentiment analysis tools
	* example for how VADER can work in conjunction with NLTK to do **sentiment analysis on longer texts**...i.e., decomposing paragraphs, articles/reports/publications, or novels into sentence-level analyses
	* examples of a concept for assessing the sentiment of images, video, or other tagged **multimedia content**
	* if you have access to the Internet, the demo has an example of how VADER can work with analyzing sentiment of **texts in other languages** (non-English text sentences).

Resources and Dataset Descriptions
====================================

The package here includes **PRIMARY RESOURCES** (items 1-3) as well as additional **DATASETS AND TESTING RESOURCES** (items 4-12):

#. vader_icwsm2014_final.pdf
    The original paper for the data set, see citation information (above).

#. vader_lexicon.txt
    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with TOKEN, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, STANDARD DEVIATION, and RAW-HUMAN-SENTIMENT-RATINGS
	NOTE: The current algorithm makes immediate use of the first two elements (token and mean valence). The final two elements (SD and raw ratings) are provided for rigor.  For example, if you want to follow the same rigorous process that we used for the study, you should find 10 independent humans to evaluate/rate each new token you want to add to the lexicon, make sure the standard deviation doesn't exceed 2.5, and take the average rating for the valence. This will keep the file consistent.
	
    DESCRIPTION: 
    Empirically validated by multiple independent human judges, VADER incorporates a "gold-standard" sentiment lexicon that is especially attuned to microblog-like contexts.
    
    The VADER sentiment lexicon is sensitive both the **polarity** and the **intensity** of sentiments expressed in social media contexts, and is also generally applicable to sentiment analysis in other domains.
	
	Sentiment ratings from 10 independent human raters (all pre-screened, trained, and quality checked for optimal inter-rater reliability). Over 9,000 token features were rated on a scale from "[‚Äì4] Extremely Negative" to "[4] Extremely Positive", with allowance for "[0] Neutral (or Neither, N/A)".  We kept every lexical feature that had a non-zero mean rating, and whose standard deviation was less than 2.5 as determined by the aggregate of those ten independent raters.  This left us with just over 7,500 lexical features with validated valence scores that indicated both the sentiment polarity (positive/negative), and the sentiment intensity on a scale from ‚Äì4 to +4. For example, the word "okay" has a positive valence of 0.9, "good" is 1.9, and "great" is 3.1, whereas "horrible" is ‚Äì2.5, the frowning emoticon :( is ‚Äì2.2, and "sucks" and it's slang derivative "sux" are both ‚Äì1.5.
	
    Manually creating (much less, validating) a comprehensive sentiment lexicon is a labor intensive and sometimes error prone process, so it is no wonder that many opinion mining researchers and practitioners rely so heavily on existing lexicons as primary resources. We are pleased to offer ours as a new resource. We began by constructing a list inspired by examining existing well-established sentiment word-banks (LIWC, ANEW, and GI). To this, we next incorporate numerous lexical features common to sentiment expression in microblogs, including:
	
    * a full list of Western-style emoticons, for example, :-) denotes a smiley face and generally indicates positive sentiment
    * sentiment-related acronyms and initialisms (e.g., LOL and WTF are both examples of sentiment-laden initialisms)
    * commonly used slang with sentiment value (e.g., nah, meh and giggly). 
	
    We empirically confirmed the general applicability of each feature candidate to sentiment expressions using a wisdom-of-the-crowd (WotC) approach (Surowiecki, 2004) to acquire a valid point estimate for the sentiment valence (polarity & intensity) of each context-free candidate feature. 

#. vaderSentiment.py
    The Python code for the rule-based sentiment analysis engine. Implements the grammatical and syntactical rules described in the paper, incorporating empirically derived quantifications for the impact of each rule on the perceived intensity of sentiment in sentence-level text. Importantly, these heuristics go beyond what would normally be captured in a typical bag-of-words model. They incorporate **word-order sensitive relationships** between terms. For example, degree modifiers (also called intensifiers, booster words, or degree adverbs) impact sentiment intensity by either increasing or decreasing the intensity. Consider these examples:
	
    (a) "The service here is extremely good" 
    (b) "The service here is good" 
    (c) "The service here is marginally good" 
	
    From Table 3 in the paper, we see that for 95% of the data, using a degree modifier increases the positive sentiment intensity of example (a) by 0.227 to 0.36, with a mean difference of 0.293 on a rating scale from 1 to 4. Likewise, example (c) reduces the perceived sentiment intensity by 0.293, on average.

#. tweets_GroundTruth.txt
    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TWEET-TEXT
	
    DESCRIPTION: includes "tweet-like" text as inspired by 4,000 tweets pulled from Twitter‚Äôs public timeline, plus 200 completely contrived tweet-like texts intended to specifically test syntactical and grammatical conventions of conveying differences in sentiment intensity. The "tweet-like" texts incorporate a fictitious username (@anonymous) in places where a username might typically appear, along with a fake URL (http://url_removed) in places where a URL might typically appear, as inspired by the original tweets. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'tweets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).

#. tweets_anonDataRatings.txt
    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, STANDARD DEVIATION, and RAW-SENTIMENT-RATINGS

#. nytEditorialSnippets_GroundTruth.txt
    FORMAT: the file is tab delimited with ID, MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING, and TEXT-SNIPPET
	
    DESCRIPTION: includes 5,190 sentence-level snippets from 500 New York Times opinion news editorials/articles; we used the NLTK tokenizer to segment the articles into sentence phrases, and added sentiment intensity ratings. The ID and MEAN-SENTIMENT-RATING correspond to the raw sentiment rating data provided in 'nytEditorialSnippets_anonDataRatings.txt' (described below).

Python Demo and Code Examples
====================================
Demo, including example of non-English text translations
------------------------------------
For a **more complete demo**, point your terminal to vader's install directory (e.g., if you installed using pip, it might be ``\Python3x\lib\site-packages\vaderSentiment``), and then run ``python vaderSentiment.py``. (Be sure you are set to handle UTF-8 encoding in your terminal or IDE... there are also additional library/package requirements such as NLTK and requests to help demonstrate some common real world needs/desired uses).

The demo has more examples of tricky sentences that confuse other sentiment analysis tools. It also demonstrates how VADER can work in conjunction with NLTK to do sentiment analysis on longer texts...i.e., decomposing paragraphs, articles/reports/publications, or novels into sentence-level analysis.  It also demonstrates a concept for assessing the sentiment of images, video, or other tagged multimedia content.

If you have access to the Internet, the demo will also show how VADER can work with analyzing sentiment of non-English text sentences. Please be aware that VADER does not inherently provide it's own translation.  The use of "My Memory Translation Service" from MY MEMORY NET (see:  http://mymemory.translated.net) is part of the demonstration showing (one way) for how to use VADER on non-English text.  (Please note the usage limits for number of requests:  http://mymemory.translated.net/doc/usagelimits.php)

Code Examples
------------------------------------
::

	from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
	#note: depending on how you installed (e.g., using source code download versus pip install), you may need to import like this:
	#from vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

    # --- examples -------
    sentences = ["VADER is smart, handsome, and funny.",  # positive sentence example
                 "VADER is smart, handsome, and funny!",  # punctuation emphasis handled correctly (sentiment intensity adjusted)
                 "VADER is very smart, handsome, and funny.", # booster words handled correctly (sentiment intensity adjusted)
                 "VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY.",  # emphasis for ALLCAPS handled
                 "VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY!!!", # combination of signals - VADER appropriately adjusts intensity
                 "VADER is VERY SMART, uber handsome, and FRIGGIN FUNNY!!!", # booster words & punctuation make this close to ceiling for score
                 "VADER is not smart, handsome, nor funny.",  # negation sentence example
                 "The book was good.",  # positive sentence
                 "At least it isn't a horrible book.",  # negated negative sentence with contraction
                 "The book was only kind of good.", # qualified positive sentence is handled correctly (intensity adjusted)
                 "The plot was good, but the characters are uncompelling and the dialog is not great.", # mixed negation sentence
                 "Today SUX!",  # negative slang with capitalization emphasis
                 "Today only kinda sux! But I'll get by, lol", # mixed sentiment example with slang and constrastive conjunction "but"
                 "Make sure you :) or :D today!",  # emoticons handled
                 "Catch utf-8 emoji such as such as üíò and üíã and üòÅ",  # emojis handled
                 "Not bad at all"  # Capitalized negation
                 ]
    
    analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    for sentence in sentences:
        vs = analyzer.polarity_scores(sentence)
        print("{:-<65} {}".format(sentence, str(vs)))


Again, for a **more complete demo**, go to the install directory and run ``python vaderSentiment.py``. (Be sure you are set to handle UTF-8 encoding in your terminal or IDE.)

====================================
About the Scoring
====================================

* The ``compound`` score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate. 
 
  It is also useful for researchers who would like to set standardized thresholds for classifying sentences as either positive, neutral, or negative.  
  Typical threshold values (used in the literature cited on this page) are:

 #. **positive sentiment**: ``compound`` score >=  0.05
 #. **neutral  sentiment**: (``compound`` score > -0.05) and (``compound`` score < 0.05)
 #. **negative sentiment**: ``compound`` score <= -0.05
 
 **NOTE:** The ``compound`` score is the one most commonly used for sentiment analysis by most researchers, including the authors.

* The ``pos``, ``neu``, and ``neg`` scores are *ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category* (so these should all add up to be 1... or close to it with float operation).  These are the most useful metrics if you want to analyze the context & presentation of how sentiment is conveyed or embedded in rhetoric for a given sentence. For example, different writing styles may embed strongly positive or negative sentiment within varying proportions of neutral text -- i.e., some writing styles may reflect a penchant for strongly flavored rhetoric, whereas other styles may use a great deal of neutral text while still conveying a similar overall (compound) sentiment. As another example: researchers analyzing information presentation in journalistic or editorical news might desire to establish whether the proportions of text (associated with a topic or named entity, for example) are balanced with similar amounts of positively and negatively framed text versus being "biased" towards one polarity or the other for the topic/entity.

  * **IMPORTANTLY:** these proportions represent the "raw categorization" of each lexical item (e.g., words, emoticons/emojis, or initialisms) into positve, negative, or neutral classes; they **do not** account for the VADER rule-based enhancements such as word-order sensitivity for sentiment-laden multi-word phrases, degree modifiers, word-shape amplifiers, punctuation amplifiers, negation polarity switches, or contrastive conjunction sensitivity.
