## Supported Platforms

For each major JavaScript platform, there is a specific high-level SDK that provides all the tools you need in a single
package. Please refer to the README and instructions of those SDKs for more detailed information:

- [`@sentry/browser`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/browser): SDK for Browsers
  including integrations for Backbone
- [`@sentry/node`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/node): SDK for Node, including
  integrations for Express, Koa, Loopback, Sails and Connect
- [`@sentry/angular`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/angular): browser SDK with Angular integration enabled
- [`@sentry/react`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/react): browser SDK with React integration enabled 
- [`@sentry/ember`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/ember): browser SDK with Ember integration enabled
- [`@sentry/vue`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/vue): browser SDK with Vue integration enabled
- [`@sentry/gatsby`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/gatsby): SDK for Gatsby
- [`@sentry/nextjs`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/nextjs): SDK for Next.js
- [`@sentry/react-native`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native): SDK for React Native with support for native crashes
- [`@sentry/integrations`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/integrations): Pluggable
  integrations that can be used to enhance JS SDKs
- [`@sentry/electron`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-electron): SDK for Electron with support for native crashes
- [`sentry-cordova`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cordova): SDK for Cordova Apps and Ionic with support for
  native crashes
- [`raven-js`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/3.x/packages/raven-js): Our old stable JavaScript
  SDK, we still support and release bug fixes for the SDK but all new features will be implemented in `@sentry/browser`
  which is the successor.
- [`raven`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/3.x/packages/raven-node): Our old stable Node SDK,
  same as for `raven-js` we still support and release bug fixes for the SDK but all new features will be implemented in
  `@sentry/node` which is the successor.

## Installation and Usage

To install a SDK, simply add the high-level package, for example:

```sh
npm install --save @sentry/browser
yarn add @sentry/browser
```

Setup and usage of these SDKs always follows the same principle.

```javascript
import { init, captureMessage } from '@sentry/browser';

init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  // ...
});

captureMessage('Hello, world!');
```
