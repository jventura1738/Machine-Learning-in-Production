## Developing Yippy
### Contributions
All contributions are welcome, whether they are pull requests, bug reports, feature requests or general feedback.

### Project Structure
There are 3 different schemes:
- Yippy
- Yippy Beta
- Yippy XCTest

__Yippy__ is used for running and archiving a production build of Yippy. __Yippy Beta__ is used for development and archiving a beta release. __Yippy XCTest__ is used exclusively for running the unit and UI tests.

### Using `create-installer.sh`
First install <a href="https://github.com/andreyvit/create-dmg" target="_blank">create-dmg</a>. Then place `X.app` in the same folder as `create-installer.sh`. Execute script:
```
./create-installer.sh X
```

You will find the installer disk image `X.dmg` in the same folder.
