# SoundRedux

**NOTE** It seems that SoundCloud has revoked my api client keys without any explanation or warning. Running the app locally no longer works unless you have a working SoundCloud API client id (SoundCloud has disabled registration of new apps for quite some time now). The live demo is also not working at the moment.

In an effort to learn es6 and [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), this is SoundRedux, a simple [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com) client

See it in action at https://soundredux.io

Uses [normalizr](https://github.com/gaearon/normalizr)

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. visit `http://localhost:8080`

Feedback, issues, etc. are more than welcome!
