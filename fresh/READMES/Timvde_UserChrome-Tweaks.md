# A community maintained repository of userChrome.css tweaks for Firefox

Every file should only contain a single, specific tweak. No full themes or anything. Users of this repository should be able to easily combine the different tweaks into a setup of their liking.

Incompatibilities between different files can happen. There's not much we can do about it. Just keep this in mind.

The master branch should always track Nightly. When a version merges into beta, a new branch is created for this specific Firefox version. If any code is broken on this branch, it is possible to cherry-pick the necessary commits without pulling other broken code in.

If you wish to contribute to this repository, please read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
