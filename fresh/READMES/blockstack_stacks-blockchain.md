# Stacks 2.0

Reference implementation of the [Stacks blockchain](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks) in Rust.

Stacks 2.0 is a layer-1 blockchain that connects to Bitcoin for security and enables decentralized apps and predictable smart contracts. Stacks 2.0 implements [Proof of Transfer (PoX)](https://blockstack.org/pox.pdf) mining that anchors to Bitcoin security. Leader election happens at the Bitcoin blockchain and Stacks (STX) miners write new blocks on the separate Stacks blockchain. With PoX there is no need to modify Bitcoin to enable smart contracts and apps around it. See [this page](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks) for more details and resources.

## Release Schedule and Hotfixes

Normal releases in this repository that add features such as improved RPC endpoints, improved boot-up time, new event
observer fields or event types, etc., are released on a monthly schedule. The currently staged changes for such releases
are in the [develop branch](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/tree/develop). It is generally safe to run
a `stacks-node` from that branch, though it has received less rigorous testing than release tags. If bugs are found in
the `develop` branch, please do report them as issues on this repository.

For fixes that impact the correct functioning or liveness of the network, _hotfixes_ may be issued. These are patches
to the main branch which are backported to the develop branch after merging. These hotfixes are categorized by priority
according to the following rubric:

- **High Priority**. Any fix for an issue that could deny service to the network as a whole, e.g., an issue where a particular kind of invalid transaction would cause nodes to stop processing requests or shut down unintentionally. Any fix for an issue that could cause honest miners to produce invalid blocks.
- **Medium Priority**. Any fix for an issue that could cause miners to waste funds
- **Low Priority**. Any fix for an issue that could deny service to individual nodes

## Versioning

This repository uses a 5 part version number.

```
X.Y.Z.A.n

X = 2 and does not change in practice unless there’s another Stacks 2.0 type event
Y increments on consensus-breaking changes
Z increments on non-consensus-breaking changes that require a fresh chainstate (akin to semantic MAJOR)
A increments on non-consensus-breaking changes that do not require a fresh chainstate, but introduce new features (akin to semantic MINOR)
n increments on patches and hot-fixes (akin to semantic PATCH)
```

For example, a node operator running version `2.0.10.0.0` would not need to wipe and refresh their chainstate
to upgrade to `2.0.10.1.0` or `2.0.10.0.1`. However, upgrading to `2.0.11.0.0` would require a new chainstate.

Stacks improvement proposals (SIPs) are aimed at describing the implementation of the Stacks blockchain, as well as proposing improvements. They should contain concise technical specifications of features or standards and the rationale behind it. SIPs are intended to be the primary medium for proposing new features, for collecting community input on a system-wide issue, and for documenting design decisions.

See [SIP 000](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-000/sip-000-stacks-improvement-proposal-process.md) for more details.

The SIPs are now located in the [stacksgov/sips](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips) repository as part of the [Stacks Community Governance organization](https://github.com/stacksgov).

### Testnet versions

- [x] **Helium** is a developer local setup, mono-node, assembling SIP 001, SIP 002, SIP 004 and SIP 005. With this version, developers can not only run Stacks 2.0 on their development machines, but also write, execute, and test smart contracts. See the instructions below for more details.

- [X] **Neon** is the first version of our public testnet, which shipped in Q2 2020. This testnet added SIP 003, and will be an open-membership public network, where participants will be able to validate and participate in mining testnet blocks.

- [X] **Argon** is the second version of our public testnet, which shipped in Q2 2020. This testnet improved on the stability of the Neon testnet.

- [X] **Krypton** is the third version of our public testnet, which incorporates a partial implementation of SIP 007.  It allows developers to test a simple version of Stacking and PoX consensus.

- [X] **Xenon** is the upcoming version of our public testnet, which will run on the Bitcoin testnet.  It will include SIP 006 and SIP 008, and will contain bugfixes and improvements to the implementation of SIP 007.

- [X] **Mainnet** is the fully functional version, that is estimated for Q4 2020.

See the [testnet website](https://testnet.blockstack.org) and ["when mainnet?" FAQ](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks/blob/master/whenmainnet.md) for details.

## Getting started

### Download and build stacks-blockchain

The first step is to ensure that you have Rust and the support software installed.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

_For building on Windows, follow the rustup installer instructions at https://rustup.rs/_

From there, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain.git

cd stacks-blockchain
```

Then build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

Run the tests:

```bash
cargo test testnet  -- --test-threads=1
```

### Encode and sign transactions

Here, we have generated a keypair that will be used for signing the upcoming transactions:

```bash
cargo run --bin blockstack-cli generate-sk --testnet

# Output
# {
#  secretKey: "b8d99fd45da58038d630d9855d3ca2466e8e0f89d3894c4724f0efc9ff4b51f001",
#  publicKey: "02781d2d3a545afdb7f6013a8241b9e400475397516a0d0f76863c6742210539b5",
#  stacksAddress: "ST2ZRX0K27GW0SP3GJCEMHD95TQGJMKB7G9Y0X1MH"
# }
```
This keypair is already registered in the `testnet-follower-conf.toml` file, so it can be used as presented here. 

We will interact with the following simple contract `kv-store`. In our examples, we will assume this contract is saved to `./kv-store.clar`:

```scheme
(define-map store { key: (string-ascii 32) } { value: (string-ascii 32) })

(define-public (get-value (key (string-ascii 32)))
    (match (map-get? store { key: key })
        entry (ok (get value entry))
        (err 0)))

(define-public (set-value (key (string-ascii 32)) (value (string-ascii 32)))
    (begin
        (map-set store { key: key } { value: value })
        (ok true)))
```

We want to publish this contract on chain, then issue some transactions that interact with it by setting some keys and getting some values, so we can observe read and writes.

Our first step is to generate and sign, using your private key, the transaction that will publish the contract `kv-store`.
To do that, we will use the subcommand:

```bash
cargo run --bin blockstack-cli publish --help
```

With the following arguments:

```bash
cargo run --bin blockstack-cli publish b8d99fd45da58038d630d9855d3ca2466e8e0f89d3894c4724f0efc9ff4b51f001 515 0 kv-store ./kv-store.clar --testnet
```

The `515` is the transaction fee, denominated in microSTX.  Right now, the
testnet requires one microSTX per byte minimum, and this transaction should be
less than 515 bytes.
The third argument `0` is a nonce, that must be increased monotonically with each new transaction.

This command will output the **binary format** of the transaction. In our case, we want to pipe this output and dump it to a file that will be used later in this tutorial.

```bash
cargo run --bin blockstack-cli publish b8d99fd45da58038d630d9855d3ca2466e8e0f89d3894c4724f0efc9ff4b51f001 515 0 kv-store ./kv-store.clar --testnet | xxd -r -p > tx1.bin
```

### Run the testnet

You can observe the state machine in action locally by running:

```bash
cargo testnet start --config=./testnet/stacks-node/conf/testnet-follower-conf.toml
```

`testnet-follower-conf.toml` is a configuration file that you can use for setting genesis balances or configuring Event observers.  You can grant an address an initial account balance by adding the following entries:

```
[[ustx_balance]]
address = "ST2VHM28V9E5QCRD6C73215KAPSBKQGPWTEE5CMQT"
amount = 100000000
```

The `address` field is the Stacks testnet address, and the `amount` field is the
number of microSTX to grant to it in the genesis block.  The addresses of the
private keys used in the tutorial below are already added.

### Publish your contract

Assuming that the testnet is running, we can publish our `kv-store` contract.

In another terminal (or file explorer), you can move the `tx1.bin` generated earlier, to the mempool:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @./tx1.bin http://localhost:20443/v2/transactions
```

In the terminal window running the testnet, you can observe the state machine's reactions.

### Reading from / Writing to the contract

Now that our contract has been published on chain, let's try to submit some read / write transactions.
We will start by trying to read the value associated with the key `foo`.

To do that, we will use the subcommand:

```bash
cargo run --bin blockstack-cli contract-call --help
```

With the following arguments:

```bash
cargo run --bin blockstack-cli contract-call b8d99fd45da58038d630d9855d3ca2466e8e0f89d3894c4724f0efc9ff4b51f001 500 1 ST2ZRX0K27GW0SP3GJCEMHD95TQGJMKB7G9Y0X1MH kv-store get-value -e \"foo\" --testnet | xxd -r -p > tx2.bin
```

`contract-call` generates and signs a contract-call transaction.

We can submit the transaction by moving it to the mempool path:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @./tx2.bin http://localhost:20443/v2/transactions
```

Similarly, we can generate a transaction that would be setting the key `foo` to the value `bar`:

```bash
cargo run --bin blockstack-cli contract-call b8d99fd45da58038d630d9855d3ca2466e8e0f89d3894c4724f0efc9ff4b51f001 500 2 ST2ZRX0K27GW0SP3GJCEMHD95TQGJMKB7G9Y0X1MH kv-store set-value -e \"foo\" -e \"bar\" --testnet | xxd -r -p > tx3.bin
```

And submit it by moving it to the mempool path:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @./tx3.bin http://localhost:20443/v2/transactions
```

Finally, we can issue a third transaction, reading the key `foo` again, for ensuring that the previous transaction has successfully updated the state machine:

```bash
cargo run --bin blockstack-cli contract-call b8d99fd45da58038d630d9855d3ca2466e8e0f89d3894c4724f0efc9ff4b51f001 500 3 ST2ZRX0K27GW0SP3GJCEMHD95TQGJMKB7G9Y0X1MH kv-store get-value -e \"foo\" --testnet | xxd -r -p > tx4.bin
```

And submit this last transaction by moving it to the mempool path:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @./tx4.bin http://localhost:20443/v2/transactions
```

Congratulations, you can now [write your own smart contracts with Clarity](https://docs.blockstack.org/core/smart/overview.html).

## Contributing

### Tests and Coverage

PRs must include test coverage. However, if your PR includes large tests or tests which cannot run in parallel
(which is the default operation of the `cargo test` command), these tests should be decorated with `#[ignore]`.
If you add `#[ignore]` tests, you should add your branch to the filters for the `all_tests` job in our circle.yml
(or if you are working on net code or marf code, your branch should be named such that it matches the existing
filters there).

A test should be marked `#[ignore]` if:

1. It does not _always_ pass `cargo test` in a vanilla environment (i.e., it does not need to run with `--test-threads 1`).
2. Or, it runs for over a minute via a normal `cargo test` execution (the `cargo test` command will warn if this is not the case).

### Formatting

This repository uses the default rustfmt formatting style. PRs will be checked against `rustfmt` and will _fail_ if not
properly formatted.

You can check the formatting locally via:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

You can automatically reformat your commit via:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
```
