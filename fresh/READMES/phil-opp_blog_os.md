# Blog OS

This repository contains the source code for the _Writing an OS in Rust_ series at [os.phil-opp.com](https://os.phil-opp.com).

If you have questions, open an issue or chat with us [on Gitter](https://gitter.im/phil-opp/blog_os).

## Where is the code?

The code for each post lives in a separate git branch. This makes it possible to see the intermediate state after each post.

**The code for the latest post is available [here][latest-post].**

[latest-post]: https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/tree/post-12

You can find the branch for each post by following the `(source code)` link in the [post list](#posts) below. The branches are named `post-XX` where `XX` is the post number, for example `post-03` for the _VGA Text Mode_ post or `post-07` for the _Hardware Interrupts_ post. For build instructions, see the Readme of the respective branch.

You can check out a branch in a subdirectory using [git worktree]:

[git worktree]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree

```
git worktree add code post-10
```

The above command creates a subdirectory named `code` that contains the code for the 10th post ("Heap Allocation").
