Contents
--------

From 2020/12, I started re-writing this book. The PDF can be downloaded for preview ([EN](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY/files/6446719/algoxy-en.pdf), [中文](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/AlgoXY/files/6446720/algoxy-zh-cn.pdf)). The 1st edition in Chinese ([中文](http://www.ituring.com.cn/book/1907)) was published in 2017. I recently switched my focus to the Mathematics of programming, the new book is also available in ([github](https://github.com/liuxinyu95/unplugged))

Install
--------

To build the book in PDF format from the sources, you need
the following software pre-installed.

- TeXLive, The book is built with XeLaTeX, a Unicode friendly version of TeX;

### Install TeXLive

In Debian/Ubuntu like Linux environment, do **NOT** install the TeXLive through apt-get. Go to TeXLive [official site](https://tug.org/texlive/) to download the setup script.

```bash
$ wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip
$ unzip install-tl.zip
$ cd install-tl
$ sudo ./install-tl -gui text -repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
```

In Windows, TeXLive provide a [gui based installer](https://tug.org/texlive/), in Mac OS X, there's a [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/).

### Install ImageMagick and Graphviz

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

For Windows and Mac OS X installer, ImageMagick can be download through http://www.imagemagick.org; Graphviz can be download from: http://graphviz.org

### Others

You need the GNU make tool, in Debian/Ubuntu like Linux, it can be installed through the apt-get command:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

In Windows, you can install the MSYS for it. In Mac OS X, please install the developer tool from this command line:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

### Build the book PDF

enter the folder contains the book TeX manuscript, run

```bash
$ make
```

This will generate algoxy-en.pdf and algoxy-zh-cn.pdf. If you only need the Chinese version for example, you can run `make cn` instead.

### Other branches

The other two branches, `zh-cn` and `jvm` are deprecated. Please do NOT checkout/track them.
