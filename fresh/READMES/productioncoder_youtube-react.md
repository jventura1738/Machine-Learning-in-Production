# 3 Screenshots

UI-wise this application looks **almost exactly like the original Youtube application**

It uses real data by leveraging the [Youtube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/).

# 4 How to run this application

This application loads information using the [Youtube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/).

To use it, you need to set up a [Youtube Data v3 API key](https://productioncoder.com/build-youtube-in-react-part-19/) and run the project with `npm` or `yarn`.

**Below, you'll find a step by step explanation**

## 4.1. Getting a Youtube Data API key

1. Head over to the [Google developers console](https://console.developers.google.com)
2. Create a new project by clicking on `Select project` drop down right next to the logo. Click the `New Project` button an give it a speaking name.
3. Select your project by choosing it in the `Select Dropdown` directly next to the logo in the header.
4. Click the `Enable APIs and Services` button
5. Search for `youtube data`
6. Click on the `Youtube Data API v3`
7. Click the blue enable button
8. In the dashboard, click `Credentials` on the left sidebar
9. Click the `Create Credential` button
10. Which API are you using: `Youtube Data API v3`
11. Where will you be calling the API from: `Web browser`
12. What data are you accessing: `Public data`
13. Click the `What credentials do I need button`
14. Copy the API key

## 4.2. Providinng the API key to your application

### 4.2.1 Option 1 - Environment variable (recommended)

Provide your Youtube Data API key with the `REACT_APP_YT_API_KEY` environment variable.

Create a `.env.local` file (alread gitignored) with

```
touch .env.local
```

and then define the `REACT_APP_YT_API_KEY` environment variable which is supposed to hold your `Youtube Data v3 API` key in the `.env.local` file like so:

```
REACT_APP_YT_API_KEY=AIzaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 4.2.2 Option 2 - hardcode API key

As an alternative, you could just hardcode the API key in the `src/App.js` file.

In general, we'd recommend going with the environment variable approach to **prevent you to accidentially commiting the API key go Git**.

However, if you do want to hardcode the `Youtube Data API key`, you can head over to the `src/App.js` file and paste your API key in:

```
const API_KEY = 'AIzaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
```

## 4.3. Installing dependencies

To install the dependencies run

```
npm install
```

With [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

```
yarn install
```

## 4.4 Running the application

### 4.4.1 Running locally with local env vars

You can run:
```
npm run dev
```

which will source your `.env.local` file and then start then run `npm start`.

Note that if you change the value of the `.env.local` file, you need to run `npm run dev` again so that the new env var changes are picked up.

As an alternative, you can manually source the `.env.local` file with

```
source .env.local
```

and then run

```
npm start
```

You can also use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) to run the application.

```
yarn start
```

**If you close the terminal, you will need to source the file again. That's why it is recommended to just run `npm run dev` so you don't need to think about it**.

### 4.4.2 Running locally with hardcoded Youtube API key

If you copied and pasted the API key directly into the code, you do not need to source anything and you can just run:

```
npm start
```

If you are using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), you can do

```
yarn start
```

**Make sure to not commit your file to Git!**
