# PacVim

PacVim is a game that teaches you vim commands.
You must move pacman (the green cursor) to highlight each word on the gameboard while avoiding the ghosts (in red).

# Building and running

Vim is a great tool to write and edit code, but many 
people, including me, struggled with the steep learning curve. 
I did not find a fun, free way to learn about the vim commands
in-depth, and thus, PacVim was born. Inspired by the classic,
PacMan, <b>PacVim</b> is a game that'll give anyone plenty of
practice with the vim commands while being a ton of fun to play.

Download and build the game with:

## Mac OS X
`brew install pacvim`

## Linux (and Mac OS X alternative)

1. Download and install Curses (graphics library) <br>
	-> For Ubuntu (in terminal): `sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev` <br>
	
	-> OR [This tutorial](http://geeksww.com/tutorials/operating_systems/linux/tools/how_to_download_compile_and_install_gnu_ncurses_on_debianubuntu_linux.php) may help (have not confirmed)
	
	-> OR build from source: [Curses source files](http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/)

	-> Mac OS X should come with Curses installed, so skip this step. 
	
<!--	-> For Mac OS X: Install Homebrew (brew.sh), then use `brew install ncurses && brew link ncurses --force`. If you get errors, type `brew tap homebrew/dupes` and try again.-->


```
2. git clone https://github.com/jmoon018/PacVim.git
3. cd PacVim
4. [sudo] make install
```

## Using Docker

If you have docker installed already, you can just:

```sh
docker run -it freedomben/pacvim [LEVEL_NUMBER] [MODE]
```

### Building the docker image from source

From the project root, build the image:

```sh
docker build -t freedomben/pacvim .
```

Push to docker hub:

```sh
docker push freedomben/pacvim
```

To play, run (from anywhere):
```
$ pacvim [LEVEL_NUMBER] [MODE]
```
You may specify the starting level and mode (`n` and `h` for normal/hard). Default mode is hard:
```
$ pacvim 8 n
```

To Uninstall, navigate to the folder where you cloned this repo, and type `make uninstall` <br>
Note: this game may not install/compile properly without gcc version 4.8.X or higher

# How To Play

The objective of PacVim is very similar to PacMan.
You must run over all the characters on the screen while avoiding the ghosts (red `G`).
PacVim has two special obstacles:

1. You cannot move into the walls (yellow color).  You must use vim motions to jump over them.

2. If you step on a tilde character (cyan `~`), you lose!

You are given three lives. You gain a life each time you beat
level 0, 3, 6, 9, etc. There are 10 levels, 0 through 9. After
beating the 9th level, the game is reset to the 0th level, but
the ghosts move faster.

<b>Winning conditions:</b> Use vim commands to move the cursor
over the letters and highlight them. After all letters are
highlighted, you win and proceed to the next level.

<b>Losing conditions:</b> If you touch a ghost (indicated
by a red `G`) or a tilde character, you lose a life. If you
have less than 0 lives, you lose the entire game.

# Create Your Own Map! 

The maps for <b>PacVim</b> are loaded from text files from
the <i>/usr/local/share/pacvim-maps</i> folder. After installing, you may, instead, use the *maps* folder (where you installed
the game) by calling `make MAPDIR=maps`.

The name of each text file must be
in a format such as: `map#.txt`, where `#` represents a number like
0, 1, 9, 14, etc. The numbers must be consecutive (can't have map0.txt,
map1.txt, and then map3.txt). <b>MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE THE NUM_OF_LEVELS 
IN GLOBALS.CPP OR ELSE YOUR NEW MAPS WON'T LOAD</b>. It should be equal
to the highest map number.

In the map text file, the walls are denoted by ampersands `#`, and the
tildes come just from the tilde key. Maps must be bounded and closed,
so the player is trapped within 4 walls. Make sure walls block the top
and left of the terminal (or else the player goes offscreen). Any
shape, height, and width, within these constraints, should work

<b>Creating Ghosts and Players</b><br>
At the bottom of each map text file, parameters about the Ghost(s)
and Players are specified

<b>Ghost:</b><br>
`/# X Y` ... EG: `/0.5 1 1`<br>
The forward slash denotes that this information describes a Ghost (instead of player).<br>
The # denotes the time, in seconds, it takes for the Ghost to move. (#=0.5 means 2 moves/sec)<br>
X and Y denote the starting x- and y-position of the Ghost<br>

<b>Player:</b> <br>
`pX Y` ... EG: `p15 7`
The 'p' denotes that this information describes a Player (instead of Ghost).<br>
The X and Y denote the starting x- and y-position of the Player. <br>
<b>This is optional</b>, the player spawns in the middle of the map otherwise<br>
<b>This should be the last line of the file</b><br>
 
<h2>Code Overview</h2>

<h4>avatar.cpp</h4>
Contains the <b>`avatar`</b> class, which contains information about
the player, such as his/her x position, y position, etc. It
also contains methods that allow the player to move and correspond
to the keystrokes. For example, the <b>`avatar`</b> class contains the method
called <b>`parseWordForward(bool)`</b> which implements the functionality
for the "w" (or "W" if true) vim command.

<h4>ghost1.cpp</h4>
Contains the <b>Ghost1</b> class, derived from the <b>`avatar`</b> class. It is
just like the avatar class, but it requires an extra paremeter
upon initialization, called `sleepTime`, a double value that
determines how quickly a ghost moves. It refers to the time, in
seconds, the ghost must wait to move. A `sleepTime` of 0.5 means
the ghost moves 2 times a second. `sleepTime` = 0.33 is 3 moves per second, etc.
<br>
The `Ghost1` class also contains a method called <b>`spawnGhost`</b> which
creates the ghost at the location based on its initialization parameters.
The ghost will appear when `READY` (global bool) is true (this means the player
is ready), and it will call <b>`ghost.think()`</b> one second afterwards.
<br>
`think` is a recursive method that simply moves the ghost. It uses 
a basic greedy algorithm based on the distance of the ghost's potential
moves (up, down, right, left) and the player.
<br>

Each ghost contains its own thread. A global mutex, called `mtx`, is
used (in `think`) to ensure that resources are shared properly.

`helperFns.cpp`
Contains methods that allow easy changes of the screen. A few of them:

* `chtype charAt(int x, int y)` returns the chtype at the (x,y) location
* `bool writeAt(int x, int y, chtype letter)` writes the 'letter' at location (x,y). Returns false if location is invalid.
* `void printAtBottom(string msg)`  writes a message one line below the last line

<h4>game.cpp</h4>
This contains the <i>main()</i> method among many other important ones

<b>main</b> - contains a loop that breaks when `LIVES` < 0. In the loop,
the proper map name is determined and loaded. Data is reset (such as as the pointers,
the ghost AI, etc). The level is incremented.
<br>
<b>init(const char*)</b> - called by <b>`main`</b>. Calls <b>`drawScreen(str map)`</b>, creates and
spawns player and ghosts threads. Then calls <b>`playGame`</b>. After <b>`playGame`</b>
ends, all the ghost threads are deleted, and then we go back to the <b>`main`</b> method.
<br>
<b>drawScreen(char* map)</b> - called by <b>`init`</b>. Reads from text file given
by parameter. Loads everything onto the screen with the proper color and gets
information from the ghost and player so that they spawn in the proper place in <b>`init`</b>.
<br>
<b>playGame(time_t, avatar player)</b> - called by <b>`init`</b>. This contains two loops,
one that consumes everything in the input buffer (which is then deleted), the second
loop allows the player to continuously input keystrokes. When a keystroke is input,
<b>`onKeystroke`</b> is called
<br>


<h2><a name="ToDoBugsTag">To-dos / Bugs</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li>More testing on `#G` and `G` commands</li>
	<li>G can go out of bounds on Map 8 with the boxes. #G (between boxes)</li>
	<li>G won't move to proper line, it can hit the last wall rather than the last word (map2)</li>
	<li>Refactor code, more comments</li>
</ul>
