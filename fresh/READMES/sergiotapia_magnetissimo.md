Magnetissimo is a self-hosted web application that indexes all popular torrent sites.

### Goals

- **No javascript**
- Crawl multiple index sites for torrents and magnet links.
- Easily integrates with both [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) and [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr).
- Run without ceremony. No need for configurations.
- Easy to understand source code. Special care is taken to keep code lean and understandable.
- High performance, leveraging Elixir's GenServer and Erlang's BEAM VM.

On average the application uses about 120MB of RAM:

We work closely with other providers and search engines to be respectful of their hardware and minimize our impact to their systems.
