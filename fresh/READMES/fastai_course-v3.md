# course-v3
The 3rd edition Practical Deep Learning for Coders. See the `nbs` folder for the notebooks. You need to use [fastai1](https://github.com/fastai/fastai1) with these notebooks - the latest version of fastai will not work.

Note that this repo is not the latest version of Part 1 of the course. For the latest version (which works correctly with the latest version of fastai), [click here](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).
