## ðŸš€ A series of exquisite and compact web page cool effects

It's like decorating a beautiful Christmas tree in a room. Sometimes a small web page with cool effects will make your project shine. This is a very fun series, I want to collect those cool effects that are common on the page.

Not limited to any framework (react, vue, angular, etc.), as long as the effect can be simply inserted into the page, you can send it to me, I like them and hope you like them too.
