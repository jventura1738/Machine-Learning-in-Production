# NYU Tandon's [OSIRIS Lab](http://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/)'s [Hack Night](https://www.osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/hack-night)
Developed from both the materials of the NYU Tandon's Introduction to Offensive Security and old Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis course, Hack Night is a sobering introduction to offensive security. A lot of complex technical content is covered very quickly as students are introduced to a wide variety of complex and immersive topics over thirteen weeks.

Hack Night culminates in a practical application of the skills and techniques taught, students complete a research project inspired by one of the lectures or exercise materials. By the end of the course, each student is expected to have a good understanding of all topics and a mastery of at least one topic.

*Due to the involved nature of this course, we recommend students attend Hack Night in person.*

## Week 1 (01/31): Introduction (Kent Ma)
This is an introduction session to the Hack Night curriculum, this session tries to give an overview of what rest of Hack Night sessions is to be followed. More importantly, it also gives the
ethics necessary to keep in mind when you learn something as powerful as you're going to do now. Next, we will cover various types of disclosure that hackers have followed since
its inception.

Before diving into the Hack Night semester, we recommend you take a look at the resources below and become familiar with some of the material.
This session will cover Code Auditing. Code Auditing an application is the process of analyzing application code (in source or binary form) to uncover vulnerabilities that attackers
might exploit. By going through this process, you can identify and close security holes that would otherwise put sensitive data and business resources at unnecessary risk.
Topics that will be covered are Identifying Architectural, Implementation and Operational vulnerabilities.

## Week 4 (02/21): Reverse Engineering, Part 1 (Mina Zhou)
This session is about Reverse Engineering. Most of the software we use everyday is closed source. You don't have the liberty to look at the source code, at this point we need to analyze the available compiled binary. Reversing a binary is no easy task but can be done with the proper methodology and the right tools.

This first week will be a primer on x86 assembly and low level programming.

### Lecture Materials
1. [Slides](<Rev/intro/Reverse Engineering, Part 1.pdf>)

### Workshop Materials
In this section we will go through the basic idea of a binary and how your source code is converted into an executable form. We will then look at the assembly language used by executable programs and develop our own low level programs. We will write simple assembly language programs and teach the basic skills needed to understand more complex assembly language uses.

This is going to be a workshop were we will write programs at assembly level. Once, we get familiar to basic x86 instructions we will switch to analyzing a real application and try to get high level understanding of what the application is doing. The goal would be to get familiar with calling conventions, stack and stack frames.

We will present you with an application which has no source code. Your job is to understand what the application is doing and figure out any loopholes present in that application. You'll use static analysis tools like IDA to analyze the binary and get a complete understanding of the application.
