# Home Assistant Configuration

[Home Assistant Container](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/#compare-installation-methods) ([Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant)) on a NAS ([Synology DiskStation DS918+](https://www.synology.com/products/DS918+)). My use case is a [wall mounted](https://www.durable.eu/information-and-presentation/tablet-holder/wall-mounted-tablet-holder/tablet-holder-wall.html) tablet ([Galaxy Tab A 10.1](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/tablets/galaxy-tab-a/galaxy-tab-a-10-1-2019-32gb-black-wi-fi-sm-t510nzkaxar/)) using [Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.ozerov.de/fully-kiosk-browser/), and on desktop using [homeassistant-desktop](https://github.com/mrvnklm/homeassistant-desktop). My configuration is exposed to HomeKit with Apple Tv acting as a hub for remote connection. I also support [Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com/).

# June 2021

While picture elements is still a valid card for layouts that doesn't follow a specific grid, this dashboard does. Instead of placing button cards using coordinates, it's now placed onto a grid that is responsive.

**Layout** `custom:layout-card`
* CSS grid everything and as a bonus...
* Mobile and portrait dashboards

**Buttons** `custom:button-card`
* Loader template doesn't need any `input_boolean` helpers anymore 
* Icons will only animate on state change to prevent all icons animating on dashboard refresh
* Some entity checks for undefined entities, no errors on restarts
* Added a bounce effect to the button when pressed

**Theme** `custom:card-mod`
* Reworked themes with focus on performance
* Wrote a tool to help with styling [card-mod-helper](https://matt8707.github.io/card-mod-helper/)

**Deprecated**
*If you're looking for picture elements, browse this repository before March 2021 [https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config/tree/c9dd19e04bd4fde2322e610a42f4e246b58ee19a](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config/tree/c9dd19e04bd4fde2322e610a42f4e246b58ee19a)*

**Includes**
Since this configuration is split into several yaml files, I'm using [lovelace-gulp-watch](https://github.com/akmolina28/lovelace-gulp-watch), which auto updates lovelace if an included file is changed.

**Known issues**
* card-mod randomly not applying markdown styling on 2021.6.0 [#130](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod/issues/130)
* swipe-card not updating size unless resizing window [#32](https://github.com/bramkragten/swipe-card/issues/32) [#147](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-layout-card/issues/147)

**Support**

I made some custom icons located in `www/custom_icons.js`. If you want to make your own I recommend reading the [material design principles](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#design-principles).
