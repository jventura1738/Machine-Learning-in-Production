#### NuGet packages

The latest pre-release packages are pushed by AppVeyor CI to [myget.org](https://www.myget.org/). To install these packages, set the myget.org package source `https://www.myget.org/F/oxyplot` and remember the "-pre" flag.

The stable release packages will be pushed to [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=oxyplot). Note that we have  have a lot of old (v2015.\*) and pre-release packages on this feed, and sometimes these show up even if they are unlisted.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot/wiki/NuGet-packages) for information about the available packages.
