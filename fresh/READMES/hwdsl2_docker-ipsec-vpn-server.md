## Quick start

Use this command to set up an IPsec VPN server on Docker:

```
docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --restart=always \
    -v ikev2-vpn-data:/etc/ipsec.d \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -d --privileged \
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
```

Your VPN login details will be randomly generated. See [Retrieve VPN login details](#retrieve-vpn-login-details).

To learn more about how to use this image, read the sections below.

## Install Docker

First, [install and run Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your Linux server. Advanced users can also use [Podman](https://podman.io) instead of Docker to run this image, after [creating an alias](https://podman.io/whatis.html) for `docker`.

Advanced users can also use this image on macOS with [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/). Note that before using IPsec/L2TP mode, you may need to restart the Docker container once with `docker restart ipsec-vpn-server`.

This image does NOT support Docker for Windows.

## Download

Get the trusted build from the [Docker Hub registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server/):

```
docker pull hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
```

Alternatively, you may download this image from [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server):

```
docker pull quay.io/hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
docker image tag quay.io/hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
```

Supported platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64` and `linux/arm/v7`.

Advanced users can [build from source code](#build-from-source-code) on GitHub.

**Note:** To use the Debian-based image, replace every `hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine` with `hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server` in this README.

## How to use this image

### Environment variables

**Note:** All the variables to this image are optional, which means you don't have to type in any variable, and you can have an IPsec VPN server out of the box! To do that, create an empty `env` file using `touch vpn.env`, and skip to the next section.

This Docker image uses the following variables, that can be declared in an `env` file (see [example](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/vpn.env.example)):

```
VPN_IPSEC_PSK=your_ipsec_pre_shared_key
VPN_USER=your_vpn_username
VPN_PASSWORD=your_vpn_password
```

This will create a user account for VPN login, which can be used by your multiple devices[*](#important-notes). The IPsec PSK (pre-shared key) is specified by the `VPN_IPSEC_PSK` environment variable. The VPN username is defined in `VPN_USER`, and VPN password is specified by `VPN_PASSWORD`.

Additional VPN users are supported, and can be optionally declared in your `env` file like this. Usernames and passwords must be separated by spaces, and usernames cannot contain duplicates. All VPN users will share the same IPsec PSK.

```
VPN_ADDL_USERS=additional_username_1 additional_username_2
VPN_ADDL_PASSWORDS=additional_password_1 additional_password_2
```

**Note:** In your `env` file, DO NOT put `""` or `''` around values, or add space around `=`. DO NOT use these special characters within values: `\ " '`. A secure IPsec PSK should consist of at least 20 random characters.

Advanced users can optionally specify a DNS name to be used as the VPN server's address. The DNS name must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). It will be included in the server certificate for IKEv2 mode, which is required for VPN clients to connect. Example:

```
VPN_DNS_NAME=vpn.example.com
```

You may optionally specify a name for the first IKEv2 client. Use one word only, no special characters except `-` and `_`. The default is `vpnclient` if not specified.

```
VPN_CLIENT_NAME=your_client_name
```

Note that the `VPN_DNS_NAME` and `VPN_CLIENT_NAME` variables have no effect if IKEv2 is already set up in the Docker container.

### Start the IPsec VPN server

Create a new Docker container from this image (replace `./vpn.env` with your own `env` file):

```
docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --env-file ./vpn.env \
    --restart=always \
    -v ikev2-vpn-data:/etc/ipsec.d \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -d --privileged \
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
```

In this command, we use the `-v` option of `docker run` to create a new [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) named `ikev2-vpn-data`, and mount the volume into `/etc/ipsec.d` in the container. IKEv2 related data such as certificates and keys will persist in the volume, and later when you need to re-create the Docker container, just specify the same volume again.

It is recommended to enable IKEv2 when using this image. However, if you prefer not to enable IKEv2 and use only the IPsec/L2TP and IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") modes to connect to the VPN, remove the `-v` option from the `docker run` command above.

**Note:** Advanced users can also [run without privileged mode](#run-without-privileged-mode).

### Retrieve VPN login details

If you did not specify an `env` file in the `docker run` command above, `VPN_USER` will default to `vpnuser` and both `VPN_IPSEC_PSK` and `VPN_PASSWORD` will be randomly generated. To retrieve them, view the container logs:

```
docker logs ipsec-vpn-server
```

Search for these lines in the output:

```
Connect to your new VPN with these details:

Server IP: your_vpn_server_ip
IPsec PSK: your_ipsec_pre_shared_key
Username: your_vpn_username
Password: your_vpn_password
```

The output will also include details for IKEv2 mode, if enabled. To start using IKEv2, see [Configure and use IKEv2 VPN](#configure-and-use-ikev2-vpn).

(Optional) Backup the generated VPN login details (if any) to the current directory:

```
docker cp ipsec-vpn-server:/etc/ipsec.d/vpn-gen.env ./
```

## Next steps

Get your computer or device to use the VPN. Please refer to:

**[Configure IPsec/L2TP VPN Clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md)**

**[Configure IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") VPN Clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients-xauth.md)**

**[Configure and use IKEv2 VPN](#configure-and-use-ikev2-vpn)**

If you get an error when trying to connect, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#troubleshooting).

Enjoy your very own VPN!

## Important notes

*Read this in other languages: [English](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/README.md#important-notes), [简体中文](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/README-zh.md#重要提示).*

**Windows users**: A [one-time registry change](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#windows-error-809) is required if the VPN server or client is behind NAT (e.g. home router).

**Android users**: If you encounter connection issues, try [these steps](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#android-mtumss-issues).

The same VPN account can be used by your multiple devices. However, due to an IPsec/L2TP limitation, if you wish to connect multiple devices simultaneously from behind the same NAT (e.g. home router), you must use only [IPsec/XAuth mode](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients-xauth.md), or [set up IKEv2](#configure-and-use-ikev2-vpn).

If you wish to add, edit or remove VPN user accounts, first update your `env` file, then you must remove and re-create the Docker container using instructions from the [next section](#update-docker-image). Advanced users can [bind mount](#bind-mount-the-env-file) the `env` file.

For servers with an external firewall (e.g. [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html)/[GCE](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls)), open UDP ports 500 and 4500 for the VPN. Aliyun users, see [#433](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/issues/433).

Clients are set to use [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) when the VPN is active. If another DNS provider is preferred, [read below](#use-alternative-dns-servers).

## Update Docker image

To update your Docker image and container, first [download](#download) the latest version:

```
docker pull hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
```

If the Docker image is already up to date, you should see:

```
Status: Image is up to date for hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
```

Otherwise, it will download the latest version. To update your Docker container, first write down all your [VPN login details](#retrieve-vpn-login-details). Then remove the Docker container with `docker rm -f ipsec-vpn-server`. Finally, re-create it using instructions from [How to use this image](#how-to-use-this-image).

## Configure and use IKEv2 VPN

*Read this in other languages: [English](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/README.md#configure-and-use-ikev2-vpn), [简体中文](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/README-zh.md#配置并使用-ikev2-vpn).*

Using this Docker image, advanced users can configure and use IKEv2. This mode has improvements over IPsec/L2TP and IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec"), and does not require an IPsec PSK, username or password. Read more [here](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/ikev2-howto.md).

First, check container logs to view details for IKEv2:

```bash
docker logs ipsec-vpn-server
```

**Note:** If you cannot find IKEv2 details, IKEv2 may not be enabled in the container. Try updating the Docker image and container using instructions from the [Update Docker image](#update-docker-image) section.

During IKEv2 setup, a new IKEv2 client (with default name `vpnclient`) is created, with its configuration exported to `/etc/ipsec.d` **inside the container**. To copy client config file(s) from the container to the current directory on the Docker host, you may use:

```bash
# Check contents of /etc/ipsec.d in the container
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ls -l /etc/ipsec.d
# Example: Copy a client config file from container to Docker host
docker cp ipsec-vpn-server:/etc/ipsec.d/vpnclient.p12 ./
```

After that, use the IKEv2 details from above to [configure IKEv2 VPN clients](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/ikev2-howto.md#configure-ikev2-vpn-clients).

You can manage IKEv2 clients using the [helper script](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/ikev2-howto.md#using-helper-scripts). See examples below. To customize client options, run the script without arguments.

```bash
# Add a new client (using default options)
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ikev2.sh --addclient [client name]
# Export configuration for an existing client
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ikev2.sh --exportclient [client name]
# List the names of existing clients
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ikev2.sh --listclients
# Show usage information
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ikev2.sh -h
```

**Note:** If you encounter error "executable file not found", replace `ikev2.sh` above with `/opt/src/ikev2.sh`.

### Use alternative DNS servers

Clients are set to use [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) when the VPN is active. If another DNS provider is preferred, define `VPN_DNS_SRV1` and optionally `VPN_DNS_SRV2` in your `env` file, then follow instructions above to re-create the Docker container. For example, if you want to use [Cloudflare's DNS service](https://1.1.1.1/dns/):

```
VPN_DNS_SRV1=1.1.1.1
VPN_DNS_SRV2=1.0.0.1
```

### Run without privileged mode

Advanced users can create a Docker container from this image without using [privileged mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities) (replace `./vpn.env` with your own `env` file):

```
docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --env-file ./vpn.env \
    --restart=always \
    -v ikev2-vpn-data:/etc/ipsec.d \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -d --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    --device=/dev/ppp \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.send_redirects=0 \
    --sysctl net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter=0 \
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
```

When running without privileged mode, the container is unable to change `sysctl` settings. This could affect certain features of this image. A known issue is that the [Android MTU/MSS fix](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/blob/master/docs/clients.md#android-mtumss-issues) also requires adding `--sysctl net.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc=1` to the `docker run` command. If you encounter any issues, try re-creating the container using [privileged mode](#start-the-ipsec-vpn-server).

After creating the Docker container, see [Retrieve VPN login details](#retrieve-vpn-login-details).

Similarly, if using [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you may replace `privileged: true` in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with:

```
  cap_add:
    - NET_ADMIN
  devices:
    - "/dev/ppp:/dev/ppp"
  sysctls:
    - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    - net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.eth0.send_redirects=0
    - net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter=0
```

For more information, see [compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).

### Access other containers on the Docker host

After connecting to the VPN, VPN clients can generally access services running in other containers on the same Docker host, without additional configuration.

For example, if the IPsec VPN server container has IP `172.17.0.2`, and an Nginx container with IP `172.17.0.3` is running on the same Docker host, VPN clients can use IP `172.17.0.3` to access services on the Nginx container. To find out which IP is assigned to a container, run `docker inspect <container name>`.

### About host network mode

Advanced users can run this image in [host network mode](https://docs.docker.com/network/host/), by adding `--network=host` to the `docker run` command. In addition, if [running without privileged mode](#run-without-privileged-mode), you may also need to replace `eth0` with the network interface name of your Docker host.

Host network mode is NOT recommended for this image, unless your use case requires it. In this mode, the container's network stack is not isolated from the Docker host, and VPN clients may be able to access ports or services on the Docker host using its internal VPN IP `192.168.42.1` after connecting using IPsec/L2TP mode. Note that you will need to manually clean up the changes to IPTables rules and sysctl settings by [run.sh](https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server/blob/master/run.sh) or reboot the server when you no longer use this image.

Some Docker host OS, such as Debian 10, cannot run this image in host network mode due to the use of nftables.

### Enable Libreswan logs

To keep the Docker image small, Libreswan (IPsec) logs are not enabled by default. If you need to enable it for troubleshooting purposes, first start a Bash session in the running container:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server env TERM=xterm bash -l
```

Then run the following commands:

```
# For Alpine-based image
apk add --no-cache rsyslog
rsyslogd
ipsec whack --shutdown
ipsec pluto --config /etc/ipsec.conf
exit
# For Debian-based image
apt-get update && apt-get -y install rsyslog
service rsyslog restart
service ipsec restart
sed -i '/pluto\.pid/a service rsyslog restart' /opt/src/run.sh
exit
```

When finished, you may check Libreswan logs with:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server grep pluto /var/log/auth.log
```

To check xl2tpd logs, run `docker logs ipsec-vpn-server`.

### Check server status

Check the status of the IPsec VPN server:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ipsec status
```

Show currently established VPN connections:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server ipsec trafficstatus
```

### Build from source code

Advanced users can download and compile the source code from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server.git
cd docker-ipsec-vpn-server
# To build Alpine-based image
docker build -f Dockerfile.alpine -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine .
# To build Debian-based image
docker build -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server .
```

Or use this if not modifying the source code:

```
# To build Alpine-based image
docker build -f Dockerfile.alpine -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine \
  github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server.git
# To build Debian-based image
docker build -t hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server.git
```

### Bash shell inside container

To start a Bash session in the running container:

```
docker exec -it ipsec-vpn-server env TERM=xterm bash -l
```

(Optional) Install the `nano` editor:

```
# For Alpine-based image
apk add --no-cache nano
# For Debian-based image
apt-get update && apt-get -y install nano
```

Then run your commands inside the container. When finished, exit the container and restart if needed:

```
exit
docker restart ipsec-vpn-server
```

### Bind mount the env file

As an alternative to the `--env-file` option, advanced users can bind mount the `env` file. The advantage of this method is that after updating the `env` file, you can restart the Docker container to take effect instead of re-creating it. To use this method, you must first edit your `env` file and use single quotes `''` to enclose the values of all variables. Then (re-)create the Docker container (replace the first `vpn.env` with your own `env` file):

```
docker run \
    --name ipsec-vpn-server \
    --restart=always \
    -v ikev2-vpn-data:/etc/ipsec.d \
    -v "$(pwd)/vpn.env:/opt/src/vpn.env:ro" \
    -p 500:500/udp \
    -p 4500:4500/udp \
    -d --privileged \
    hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server:alpine
```

## Technical details

There are two services running: `Libreswan (pluto)` for the IPsec VPN, and `xl2tpd` for L2TP support.

The default IPsec configuration supports:

* IPsec/L2TP with PSK
* IKEv1 with PSK and XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")
* IKEv2

The ports that are exposed for this container to work are:

* 4500/udp and 500/udp for IPsec
