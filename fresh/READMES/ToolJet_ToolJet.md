  Build and deploy internal tools.
</p>

ToolJet is an **open-source no-code framework** to build and deploy internal tools quickly without much effort from the engineering teams. You can connect to your data sources such as databases ( like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, etc ), API endpoints ( ToolJet supports importing OpenAPI spec & OAuth2 authorization) and external services ( like Stripe, Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable ) and use our pre-built UI widgets to build internal tools.
