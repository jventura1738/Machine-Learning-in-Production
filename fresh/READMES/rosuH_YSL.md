### 🏞Yellowstone Sound Library 🎵

This warehouse collects the public sound library of Yellowstone Park. These sounds contain the sounds of the natural environment and animals.
You can use this audio as a BGM for your work👩‍💻, study📖 or meditation🙇‍♂️.

# Download

Since Github has a size limit on the uploaded file, I uploaded it to the [Web Archive](https://archive.org/details/YSL.7z).
Or you can just clone the repo.
