# Ubuntu Yaru theme suite

Snap build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ubuntu/yaru.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ubuntu/yaru)

Yaru is the default theme for Ubuntu, backed by the community.

It contains:
 * a GNOME Shell theme based on the [upstream GNOME shell theme](https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-shell/tree/master/data/theme)
 * a light and dark GTK theme (gtk2 and gtk3) based on the [upstream Adwaita Gtk theme](https://github.com/GNOME/gtk/tree/gtk-3-24/gtk/theme/Adwaita)
 * an icon & cursor theme, derived from the Unity8 Suru icons and [Suru icon](https://snwh.org/suru) theme
 * a sound theme, combining sounds from the [WoodenBeaver](https://github.com/madsrh/WoodenBeaver) and [Touch-Remix](https://github.com/madsrh/TouchRemix) sound themes.
