# 1. Introduction

**OpenRCT2** is an open-source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 (RCT2). The gameplay revolves around building and maintaining an amusement park containing attractions, shops and facilities. The player must try to make a profit and maintain a good park reputation whilst keeping the guests happy. OpenRCT2 allows for both scenario and sandbox play. Scenarios require the player to complete a certain objective in a set time limit whilst sandbox allows the player to build a more flexible park with optionally no restrictions or finance.

RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was originally written by Chris Sawyer in x86 assembly and is the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon. The engine was based on Transport Tycoon, an older game which also has an equivalent open-source project, [OpenTTD](https://openttd.org). OpenRCT2 attempts to provide everything from RCT2 as well as many improvements and additional features, some of these include support for modern platforms, an improved interface, improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Some of those include; mountain tool in-game, the *"have fun"* objective, launched coasters (not passing-through the station) and several buttons on the toolbar.

# 2. Downloading the game (pre-built)

OpenRCT2 requires original files of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. It can be bought at either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/) or [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2). If you have the original RollerCoaster Tycoon and its expansion packs, you can [point OpenRCT2 to these](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Loading-RCT1-scenarios-and-data) in order to play the original scenarios.

[OpenRCT2.org](https://openrct2.org/downloads) offers precompiled builds and installers of the latest master and the develop branch. There is also a cross platform [Launcher](https://github.com/LRFLEW/OpenRCT2Launcher/releases) available that will automatically update your build of the game so that you always have the latest version.

[Flathub](https://flathub.org/) offers flatpaks for Linux distributions that support this application distribution system:
* [Latest stable release](https://flathub.org/repo/appstream/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2.flatpakref)
* [Latest development build](https://flathub.org/beta-repo/appstream/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2.flatpakref)

Some Linux distributions offer native packages already. These packages are usually third-party, but we're trying to resolve issues they are facing.
* ArchLinux: [openrct2-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openrct2-git) (AUR) and [openrct2](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/openrct2/) (Community)

# 3. Building the game

## 3.1 Building prerequisites

OpenRCT2 requires original files of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 to play. It can be bought at either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/) or [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2).

### Windows:
- Visual Studio 2019 (Enterprise / Professional / [Community (Free)](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/))
  - Desktop development with C++

### macOS:
- Xcode 10+

The program can also be built as a command line program using CMake. This type of build requires:

- Xcode Command Line Tools
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- CMake (available through Homebrew)


### Linux:
- sdl2 (only for UI client)
- freetype (can be disabled)
- fontconfig (can be disabled)
- libzip (>= 1.0)
- libpng (>= 1.2)
- speexdsp (only for UI client)
- curl (only if building with http support)
- nlohmann-json (>= 3.6.0)
- openssl (>= 1.0; only if building with multiplayer support)
- icu (>= 59.0)
- zlib
- gl (commonly provided by Mesa or GPU vendors; only for UI client, can be disabled)
- duktape (unless scripting is disabled)
- cmake
- innoextract (optional runtime dependency; used for GOG installer extraction during setup)

Refer to https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Building-OpenRCT2-on-Linux#required-packages-general for more information about installing the packages.

## 3.2 Compiling and running
### Windows:
1. Check out the repository. This can be done using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [other tools](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use).
2. Open a new Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019, then navigate to the repository (e.g. `cd C:\GitHub\OpenRCT2`).
3. To build the 64-bit version, use `msbuild openrct2.proj /t:build /p:platform=x64`.

   To build the 32-bit version, use `msbuild openrct2.proj /t:build /p:platform=Win32`.
4. Run the game, `bin\openrct2`

Once you have ran msbuild once, further development can be done within Visual Studio by opening `openrct2.sln`. Make sure to select the correct target platform for which you ran the build in point #3 (`Win32` for the 32-bit version, `x64` for the 64-bit version), otherwise the build will fail in Visual Studio.

Other examples:
```
set platform=x64
msbuild openrct2.proj /t:clean
msbuild openrct2.proj /t:rebuild /p:configuration=release
msbuild openrct2.proj /t:g2
msbuild openrct2.proj /t:PublishPortable
```

### macOS:
#### Xcode:
The recommended way of building OpenRCT2 for macOS is with Xcode. The Xcode build will create a self-contained application bundles which include all the necessary game files and dependencies. Open the project file OpenRCT2.xcodeproj in Xcode and build from there. Building this way will handle the dependencies for you automatically. You can also invoke an Xcode build from the command line using `xcodebuild`.

#### CMake:
A command line version of OpenRCT2 can be built using CMake. CMake will retrieve the dependences from [Dependencies](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/Dependencies/) automatically. You can build the project using CMake using the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
ln -s ../data data
```
Then you can run the game by running `./openrct2`.

Detailed instructions can be found on [Building OpenRCT2 on macOS using CMake](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Building-OpenRCT2-on-macOS-using-CMake).

### Linux:
The standard CMake build procedure is to install the [required libraries](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2#linux), then:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ # set your standard cmake options, e.g. build type here - For example, -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
make # you can parallelise your build job with e.g. -j8 or consider using ninja
DESTDIR=. make install # the install target creates all the necessary files in places we expect them
```

You can also use Ninja in place of Make, if you prefer, see Wiki for details.

Detailed instructions can be found on [Building OpenRCT2 on Linux](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/wiki/Building-OpenRCT2-on-Linux).
