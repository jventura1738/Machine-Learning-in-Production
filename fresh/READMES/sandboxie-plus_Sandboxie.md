Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. It creates a sandbox-like isolated operating environment in which applications can be run or installed without permanently modifying local & mapped drives or the windows registry. An isolated virtual environment allows controlled testing of untrusted programs and web surfing.

## System requirements
Windows 7 or higher, 32-bit or 64-bit.

## Features
Sandboxie is available in two flavors, Plus and Classic. Both have the same core components, this means they have the same level of security and compatibility.
What's different is the availability of features in the user interface:

1) Plus build has a modern Qt based UI, which supports all new features that have been added since the project went open source.
If you need an accurate list, you can take a look at the changelog above.

2) Classic build has the old no longer developed MFC based UI, hence it lacks native support for Plus features. However, most of them can be configured manually in the Sandboxie.ini configuration file, and some valuable [contributions](https://sandboxie-website-archive.github.io/www.sandboxie.com/old-forums/viewforum1a2d1a2d.html?f=22) can still be applied nowadays.

## Documentation
A GitHub copy of the [Sandboxie documentation](https://sandboxie-plus.github.io/sandboxie-docs) is currently maintained, although more volunteers are needed to keep it updated with the new changes. We recommend to check also the [documentation](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues?q=label%3Adocumentation), [workaround](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/issues?q=label%3Aworkaround) and [future development](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/labels/future%20development) labels in this repository.

A partial archive of the [old Sandboxie forum](https://sandboxie-website-archive.github.io/www.sandboxie.com/old-forums) that was previously maintained by Invincea is still available. If you need to find something there, please use the corresponding [repository search](https://github.com/Sandboxie-Website-Archive/sandboxie-website-archive.github.io).
