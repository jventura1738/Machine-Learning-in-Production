Quest 5
=======

Quest lets you make interactive story games – you can make text adventure games (like *Zork*, or *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*) and gamebooks (like the *Choose Your Own Adventure* books). It lets you create sophisticated games complete with graphics, sounds and videos, all without having to know how to program yourself - a full visual editor is included.

* Visual script editor. A plain English approach to programming, where you can choose commands from searchable lists, so you don't need to remember any syntax
* Highly customisable - most functionality comes from a Core library, which is written in the Quest game language (ASLX) itself
* Games support unlimited undo
* Games are fully translatable - there is no hard coded text within a game. You can translate the English template to create games in other languages - we already have support for Spanish, German and Dutch.
* HTML game output allows embedding sounds, pictures, YouTube, Vimeo clips
* XML game file format is easily editable outside of Quest if you don't want to use Quest's own editor
* Games can be played online by uploading the .quest file to [textadventures.co.uk](http://textadventures.co.uk/), or you can use the WebPlayer project to host them yourself on a web server with ASP.NET
* MIT licence means you're free to create commercial Quest games, and use Quest in closed-source projects
