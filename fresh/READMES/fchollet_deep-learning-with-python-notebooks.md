# Companion Jupyter notebooks for the book "Deep Learning with Python"

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book [Deep Learning with Python, 2nd Edition (Manning Publications)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff).

For readability, these notebooks only contain runnable code blocks and section titles, and omit everything else in the book: text paragraphs, figures, and pseudocode.
**If you want to be able to follow what's going on, I recommend reading the notebooks side by side with your copy of the book.**

These notebooks use TensorFlow 2.6.
