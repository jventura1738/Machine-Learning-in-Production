# INTRODUCTION

Quick Tabs is a tab management browser extension for the Google Chrome web browser based on the "Recent Files" quick selector built into the excellent IntelliJ IDEA by Jetbrains.

Quick Tabs allows you to move quickly between recently used tabs without requiring the use of your mouse, locate and switch to tabs as you need them with minimal keystrokes even when you have large numbers of open tabs.

Visit the [Quick Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb) google extensions page to install and try it out ...

# FEATURES

* Lists all the open tabs in Chrome across all of your open windows
* Tabs are listed in most recently used (MRU) order and excludes the current tab (since you're switching tabs)
* Fuzzy search your bookmarks:
  * Bookmarks are automatically searched when only a few tabs match your search string
  * Add a space at the start or end of your search string to search bookmarks along with tabs
  * Start your search with `/b` or add **two spaces** at the start or end of your search string to search only bookmarks
  * delete bookmarks directly from the search results by clicking the 'x'
* Fuzzy search your browser history:
  * Start your search with `/h` or add **three spaces** at the start or end of your search string to search browser history
* Find noisy tabs by searching for `<))`
* Chrome keyboard shortcuts (configured using the keyboard shortcuts dialog at the bottom of the Chrome Extensions page):
  * Shortcut key to launch popup window from most tabs (default ctrl+e, cmd+e on Mac, ctrl+q on Linux).
  * Select previous tab without loading the popup window (unmapped by default)
  * Select next tab without loading the popup window (unmapped by default)
  * IMPORTANT the 'next tab' shortcut is only available for a second or so (while the badge text is orange) before the current tab is moved to the top of the MRU list.
  * Duplicate the current tab without (unmapped by default)
* Tab list popup shortcut keys:
  * Select previous tab (same as Chrome keyboard shortcut or up arrow)
  * Select next tab (same as Chrome keyboard shortcut or down arrow)
  * Switch to selected Item (enter)
  * Duplicate the selected item and switch to it (same as Chrome keyboard shortcut, unmapped by default)
  * To close selected tab (default ctrl+d, see extension options)
* Displays the number of tabs you currently have open in all your Chrome windows
* Quickly search and select tabs by typing letters in the page title or url
* Track recently closed tabs and allow them to be searched and restored
* Popup customization using css

# COMMANDS

Commands start with a `/` and can be typed in the popup window search box to tweak the search behaviour or perform actions on tabs;

### Query Commands

* `/b <query>` - search bookmarks
* `/h <query>` - search browser history
* `/w <query>` - search the tabs in the current window only
* `/p <query>` - search pinned tabs only
* `/g <query>` - search tabs that belong to the same tab group as the current tab (or no tab group if it's not in a group)

### Search Types

You can now change the search type for a single search, this can help if you have a specific search string in engine combo in mind.

* `/fuzzy <query>` - use the fuzzy search engine for this query only 
* `/fuse <query>` - use the fuse search engine for this query only 
* `/regex <query>` - use the regex search engine for this query only 
* `/subs <query>` - use the subs search engine for this query only 

### Tab Management

Tab management commands all accept RegExp search queries.

* `/close <query>` - search for and close tabs
* `/merge <query>` - merge tabs into the current window
* `/split <query>` - split tabs and move them into a new window
* `/reload <query>` - reload all the tabs in the search result
* `/mute <query>` - mute the tabs in the search result
* `/unmute <query>` - unmute the tabs in the search result
* `/group <query>` - create new tab groups or move tabs into groups using the search results

# PERMISSIONS

* **Read and change your browsing history**: _read only_ access is required to record your open tabs and search browser history.
* **Read and change your bookmarks**: _read/write_ access is required to search, display and remove (by clicking the 'x' in the results list) bookmarks.
