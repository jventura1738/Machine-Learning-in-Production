# **SteamVR Unity Plugin**

Valve maintains a Unity plugin to smoothly interface SteamVR with Unity. With SteamVR developers can target one API that all the popular VR headsets can connect to. The modern SteamVR Unity Plugin manages three main things for developers: loading 3d models for VR controllers, handling input from those controllers, and estimating what your hand looks like while using those controllers. On top of managing those things we have an Interaction System example to help get your VR application off the ground. Providing concrete examples of interacting with the virtual world and our APIs.


### Requirements
The SteamVR runtime must be installed. This can be downloaded from Steam under the Tools category. Or by [clicking here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/). As developers we strongly recommend that you opt-in to SteamVR beta so you can test new features and verify your application works with the latest versions of SteamVR.

 * This version of the SteamVR Unity Plugin is compatible and has been tested with Unity versions 5.4 - 2019.1
