# Unity Open Project #1: Chop Chop

![Unity Open Projects](/Docs/ReadmeImages/ApproachingTheIsland_Header.jpg)

Welcome! This is the repository for the first Unity **Open Project**, an initiative where Unity and the community collaborate together to create a small **open-source game demo**.

The first game, which is currently under development, is an action-adventure titled _Chop Chop_ ([more info](https://open.codecks.io/unity-open-project-1/decks/32/card/126-what-is-this)).

## Follow the progress
* The [dedicated sub-forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/open-projects.531/) on the Unity forums is where the Unity team and the whole community discuss and brainstorm ideas.  
* The [roadmap](https://open.codecks.io/unity-open-project-1) is the central location to know what's coming to the game. Also a great way to find tasks to contribute on!  
* The Unity team does bi-weekly livestreams on Unity's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/unity/) (subscribe to be notified). Find the past ones [in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0S6CnkDm0AwVgA6E6L_vJNf).  
* The [#open-projects channel](https://discord.gg/EZBXA4V) on the Official Unity Discord is where collaborators can meet for a quick chat and non-threaded discussion.

## Contribute
We would love to get your contributions into the game! Whether you create code, art, narrative, sounds; whether you feel you are experienced enough or not; there is probably [something](https://open.codecks.io/unity-open-project-1) you can add to it.

To learn all about contributing, we have [a series of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbSrx0QoTG4&list=PLZplUm29-Z-xOYY9Tw6t3tSIvlbhVhzUn) to get you started with Git and with this project in general.  
In addition to that, make sure you read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwBF4yQl69RxvVHZ2m2iiy5pYjd9QO-VcuXWDjB7QwA/edit#). For code style, scene hierarchy, and project organisation standards, read the [Conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-eUWZ0lWREFu5iH-ggofwnixDDQqalOoT4Yc0NpWR3k/edit) document. And for art contributions, we have the [Art Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18zqe31J8EipTiEBZuwzLyG3jH7-5teAOViLEio4uko8/).  
⚠  Please **post on the [forums](https://forum.unity.com/forums/open-projects.531/) and check the [roadmap](https://open.codecks.io/unity-open-project-1) before starting to work on big contributions!**

If you feel like taking on some **bugs**, check out the [Issues page](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/issues) on this very repo. In fact, another thing you could help with is by doing some **QA testing**: download the [latest release](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/releases) of the game, play it, and report issues in the appropriate page. That's also a great way to be part of this project!

This project is built on **Unity 2020.3 LTS**, whatever latest patch is available (you can see exactly which version [here](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1/blob/main/UOP1_Project/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt)).
