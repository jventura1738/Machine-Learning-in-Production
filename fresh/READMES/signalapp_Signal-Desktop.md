## Install the beta

You can install the beta version of Signal Desktop alongside the production version. The beta uses different data and install locations.

Download the installer by constructing a final URL that looks like this: `https://updates.signal.org/desktop/<installer location>`. Then run the installer.
- _macOS:_ First, download [this file](https://updates.signal.org/desktop/beta-mac.yml) and look for the `url` property that specifies the location for the latest beta installer. Download the installer by constructing a final URL that looks like this: `https://updates.signal.org/desktop/<package location>`. Then unzip that package and copy the `.app` file into the `/Applications` folder using Finder.
