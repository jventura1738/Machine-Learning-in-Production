**Janet** is a functional and imperative programming language and bytecode interpreter. It is a
lisp-like language, but lists are replaced
by other data structures (arrays, tables (hash table), struct (immutable hash table), tuples).
The language also supports bridging to native code written in C, meta-programming with macros, and bytecode assembly.

There is a REPL for trying out the language, as well as the ability
to run script files. This client program is separate from the core runtime, so
Janet can be embedded in other programs. Try Janet in your browser at
[https://janet-lang.org](https://janet-lang.org).

If you'd like to financially support the ongoing development of Janet, consider
[sponsoring its primary author](https://github.com/sponsors/bakpakin) through GitHub.

## Use Cases

Janet makes a good system scripting language, or a language to embed in other programs.
It's like Lua and Guile in that regard. It has more built-in functionality and a richer core language than
Lua, but smaller than GNU Guile or Python.

## Features

* Minimal setup - one binary and you are good to go!
* First-class closures
* Garbage collection
* First-class green threads (continuations)
* Python-style generators (implemented as a plain macro)
* Mutable and immutable arrays (array/tuple)
* Mutable and immutable hashtables (table/struct)
* Mutable and immutable strings (buffer/string)
* Macros
* Byte code interpreter with an assembly interface, as well as bytecode verification
* Tail call Optimization
* Direct interop with C via abstract types and C functions
* Dynamically load C libraries
* Functional and imperative standard library
* Lexical scoping
* Imperative programming as well as functional
* REPL
* Parsing Expression Grammars built into the core library
* 400+ functions and macros in the core library
* Embedding Janet in other programs
* Interactive environment with detailed stack traces

## Documentation

* For a quick tutorial, see [the introduction](https://janet-lang.org/docs/index.html) for more details.
* For the full API for all functions in the core library, see [the core API doc](https://janet-lang.org/api/index.html)

Documentation is also available locally in the REPL.
Use the `(doc symbol-name)` macro to get API
documentation for symbols in the core library. For example,
```
(doc apply)
```
Shows documentation for the `apply` function.

To get a list of all bindings in the default
environment, use the `(all-bindings)` function. You
can also use the `(doc)` macro with no arguments if you are in the REPL
to show bound symbols.

## Source

You can get the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/janet-lang/janet) or
[SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~bakpakin/janet). While the GitHub repo is the official repo,
the SourceHut mirror is actively maintained.

## Building

### macOS and Unix-like

The Makefile is non-portable and requires GNU-flavored make.

```
cd somewhere/my/projects/janet
make
make test
make repl
```

Find out more about the available make targets by running `make help`.

### 32-bit Haiku

32-bit Haiku build instructions are the same as the UNIX-like build instructions,
but you need to specify an alternative compiler, such as `gcc-x86`.

```
cd somewhere/my/projects/janet
make CC=gcc-x86
make test
make repl
```

### FreeBSD

FreeBSD build instructions are the same as the UNIX-like build instructions,
but you need `gmake` to compile. Alternatively, install directly from
packages, using `pkg install lang/janet`.

```
cd somewhere/my/projects/janet
gmake
gmake test
gmake repl
```

### NetBSD

NetBSD build instructions are the same as the FreeBSD build instructions.
Alternatively, install directly from packages, using `pkgin install janet`.

### Windows

1. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15#) or [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15#)
2. Run a Visual Studio Command Prompt (cl.exe and link.exe need to be on the PATH) and cd to the directory with janet.
3. Run `build_win` to compile janet.
4. Run `build_win test` to make sure everything is working.

To build an `.msi` installer executable, in addition to the above steps, you will have to:

5. Install, or otherwise add to your PATH the [WiX 3.11 Toolset](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases)
6. run `build_win dist`

Now you should have an `.msi`. You can run `build_win install` to install the `.msi`, or execute the file itself.

### Meson

Janet also has a build file for [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/), a cross-platform build
system. Although Meson has a Python dependency, Meson is a very complete build system that
is maybe more convenient and flexible for integrating into existing pipelines.
Meson also provides much better IDE integration than Make or batch files, as well as support
for cross-compilation.

For the impatient, building with Meson is as follows. The options provided to
`meson setup` below emulate Janet's Makefile.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/janet-lang/janet.git
cd janet
meson setup build \
          --buildtype release \
          --optimization 2 \
          --libdir /usr/local/lib \
          -Dgit_hash=$(git log --pretty=format:'%h' -n 1)
ninja -C build

# Run the binary
build/janet

# Installation
ninja -C build install
```

## Development

Janet can be hacked on with pretty much any environment you like, but for IDE
lovers, [Gnome Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder) is probably the
best option, as it has excellent meson integration. It also offers code completion
for Janet's C API right out of the box, which is very useful for exploring. VSCode, Vim,
Emacs, and Atom will have syntax packages for the Janet language, though.

## Installation

See the [Introduction](https://janet-lang.org/docs/index.html) for more details. If you just want
to try out the language, you don't need to install anything. You can also move the `janet` executable wherever you want on your system and run it.

## Usage

A REPL is launched when the binary is invoked with no arguments. Pass the -h flag
to display the usage information. Individual scripts can be run with `./janet myscript.janet`

If you are looking to explore, you can print a list of all available macros, functions, and constants
by entering the command `(all-bindings)` into the REPL.

```
$ janet
Janet 1.7.1-dev-951e10f  Copyright (C) 2017-2020 Calvin Rose
janet:1:> (+ 1 2 3)
6
janet:2:> (print "Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
nil
janet:3:> (os/exit)
$ janet -h
usage: build/janet [options] script args...
Options are:
  -h : Show this help
  -v : Print the version string
  -s : Use raw stdin instead of getline like functionality
  -e code : Execute a string of janet
  -r : Enter the REPL after running all scripts
  -p : Keep on executing if there is a top-level error (persistent)
  -q : Hide prompt, logo, and REPL output (quiet)
  -k : Compile scripts but do not execute (flycheck)
  -m syspath : Set system path for loading global modules
  -c source output : Compile janet source code into an image
  -n : Disable ANSI color output in the REPL
  -l path : Execute code in a file before running the main script
  -- : Stop handling options
```

If installed, you can also run `man janet` and `man jpm` to get usage information.

## Embedding

Janet can be embedded in a host program very easily. The normal build
will create a file `build/janet.c`, which is a single C file
that contains all the source to Janet. This file, along with
`src/include/janet.h` and `src/conf/janetconf.h` can be dragged into any C
project and compiled into the project. Janet should be compiled with `-std=c99`
on most compilers, and will need to be linked to the math library, `-lm`, and
the dynamic linker, `-ldl`, if one wants to be able to load dynamic modules. If
there is no need for dynamic modules, add the define
`-DJANET_NO_DYNAMIC_MODULES` to the compiler options.

See the [Embedding Section](https://janet-lang.org/capi/embedding.html) on the website for more information.

## Examples

See the examples directory for some example janet code.

## Discussion

Gitter provides Matrix and irc bridges as well.

## FAQ

### Why is my terminal spitting out junk when I run the REPL?

Make sure your terminal supports ANSI escape codes. Most modern terminals will
support these, but some older terminals, Windows consoles, or embedded terminals
will not. If your terminal does not support ANSI escape codes, run the REPL with
the `-n` flag, which disables color output. You can also try the `-s` if further issues
ensue.

### Where is (favorite feature from other language)?

It may exist, it may not. If you want to propose major language features, go ahead and open an issue, but
they will likely by closed as "will not implement". Often, such features make one usecase simpler at the expense
of 5 others by making the language more complicated.

### Where is the example code?

In the examples directory.

### Is this a Clojure port?

No. It's similar to Clojure superficially because I like Lisps and I like the asthetics.
Internally, Janet is not at all like Clojure.

### Are the immutable data structures (tuples and structs) implemented as hash tries?

No. They are immutable arrays and hash tables. Don't try and use them like Clojure's vectors
and maps, instead they work well as table keys or other identifiers.

### Why can't we add (feature from Clojure) into the core?

Usually, one of a few reasons:
- Often, it already exists in a different form and the Clojure port would be redundant.
- Clojure programs often generate a lot of garbage and rely on the JVM to clean it up.
  Janet does not run on the JVM. We admittedly have a much more primitive GC.
- We want to keep the Janet core small. With Lisps, usually a feature can be added as a library
  without feeling "bolted on", especially when compared to ALGOL like languages.

## Why is it called "Janet"?

Janet is named after the almost omniscient and friendly artificial being in [The Good Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place).
