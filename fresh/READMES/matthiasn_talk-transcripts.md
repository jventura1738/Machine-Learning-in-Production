talk-transcripts
================

This is a compilation of transcripts of talks that I find interesting. I learn better when I read something rather than hearing it, and I have a hunch that I'm not the only one who feels that way. So I thought I'd make the talks more accessible to anyone for whom listening to the talks might not be the most viable or simply not the most preferred option.

**Please**, if you read any of the transcripts and find that a URL is mentioned in the talk and you go look it up, can you submit a pull request turning that into an actual link in the transcript? It is really simple, just click on the pencil button above the document and turn the mention in the text into a markdown-style link like this: ````**[blah.com or whatever was in the transcript](http://blah.com)**````. Thanks, you're making the transcripts more useful.
