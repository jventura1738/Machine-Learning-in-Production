# autoEdit 2

autoEdit 2 is a fast text based video editing, desktop app for Mac, Linux and Windows, built with node and electron, and Backbone front end. For making video production faster, easier and more accessible.


## Ready to use release

All you need to get started is to decide what speech to text service you want to use and get some credentials to get going [check out the user manual for more details](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/setup-stt-apis.html) 

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2.git

Compiles the js client side files with browserify and starts electron

_Note:_ You'd also need to get Speech to text keys or have the Gentle Open source app running locally [check out the user manual for more details](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/autoedit2-user-manual/content/setup-stt-apis.html), unless you are choosing `pocketsphinx` as speech to text option.

However they still need to be fixed up a bit. And perhaps move to `jest`.
