**remark** is a Markdown processor built on [micromark][] powered by
[plugins][] part of the [unified][] collective.

## Intro

**remark** is [the worldâ€™s most popular Markdown parser][popular]!
And it does so much more than parse: it inspects (check, lint) and transforms
(generate, compile) Markdown too!

Everything is possible with plugins, such as [checking Markdown code
style (`remark-lint`)][remark-lint], [transforming safely to React
(`remark-react`)][remark-react], [adding a table of
contents (`remark-toc`)][remark-toc], or [compiling to man pages
(`remark-man`)][remark-man].

Internally, remark now uses [micromark][], a new, fast, and tiny CommonMark
compliant Markdown tokenizer.
It can be GFM compliant with [`remark-gfm`][remark-gfm].

Finally, remark is part of the [unified][website] [collective][governance].

    overview

## Packages

This repository contains the following packages:

*   [`remark-parse`][parse] â€” Parse Markdown to syntax trees
*   [`remark-stringify`][stringify] â€” Serialize syntax trees to Markdown
*   [`remark`][api] â€” Programmatic interface with both `remark-parse` and `remark-stringify`
*   [`remark-cli`][cli] â€” Command line interface wrapping `remark`

## Security

As Markdown is sometimes used for HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up
to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of remark can also be unsafe.
When going to HTML, use remark in combination with the [**rehype**][rehype]
ecosystem, and use [`rehype-sanitize`][sanitize] to make the tree safe.

Use of remark plugins could also open you up to other attacks.
Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.
