ehtim (eht-imaging)
===================

Python modules for simulating and manipulating VLBI data and producing images with regularized maximum likelihood methods. This version is an early release so please raise an issue, submit a pull request, or email achael@princeton.edu if you have trouble or need help for your application.

The package contains several primary classes for loading, simulating, and manipulating VLBI data. The main classes are the ``Image``, ``Movie``, ``Array``, ``Obsdata``, ``Imager``, and ``Caltable`` classes, which provide tools for loading images and data, producing simulated data from realistic u-v tracks,  calibrating, inspecting, and  plotting data, and producing images from data sets in various polarizations using various data terms and regularizing functions.


Installation
------------

The latest stable version (`1.2.2 <https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging/releases/tag/v1.2.2>`_) is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/ehtim/>`_. Simply install pip and run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ehtim

Incremental updates are developed on the `dev branch <https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging/tree/dev>`_. To use the very latest (unstable) code, checkout the dev branch, change to the main eht-imaging directory, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .

Installing with pip will update most of the required libraries automatically (`numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, `matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org/>`_, `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_, `ephem <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyephem/>`_, `future <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/future>`_, `h5py <http://www.h5py.org/>`_, and `pandas <http://www.pandas.pydata.org/>`_).

**If you want to use fast fourier transforms, you will also need to separately install** `NFFT <https://github.com/NFFT/nfft>`_ **and its** `pynfft wrapper <https://github.com/ghisvail/pyNFFT/>`_. The simplest way is to use `conda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pynfft/>`__ to install both:


.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pynfft

Alternatively, first install NFFT manually following the instructions on the `readme <https://github.com/NFFT/nfft>`_, making sure to use the ``--enable-openmp`` flag in compilation. Then install `pynfft <https://github.com/ghisvail/pyNFFT/>`_, with pip, following the readme instructions to link the installation to where you installed NFFT. Finally, reinstall ehtim.

**Certain eht-imaging functions require other external packages that are not automatically installed.** In addition to pynfft, these include  `networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ (for image comparison functions), `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_ (for dynamical imaging), and `scikit-image <https://scikit-image.org/>`_ (for Hough transforms). However, the vast majority of the code will work without these dependencies. 

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is  `here <https://achael.github.io/eht-imaging>`_ .

A full tutorial is in progress, but here are some ways to learn to use the code:

- Start with the script examples/example.py, which contains a series of sample commands to load an image and array, generate data, and produce an image with various imaging algorithms.

- `Slides <https://www.dropbox.com/s/7533ucj8bt54yh7/Bouman_Chael.pdf?dl=0>`_ from the EHT2016 data generation and imaging workshop contain a tutorial on generating data with the VLBI imaging `website <http://vlbiimaging.csail.mit.edu>`_, loading into the library, and producing an image.
