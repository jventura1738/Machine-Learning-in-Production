# Installing Binaries
Binaries can be downloaded from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/releases). 
Currently RPM, DEB, APT, Snap, Flatpak and AppImage for Linux, 
zipped EXE for Windows and 
APP for macOS in a DMG package are available.

### Continuous build
All supported binaries are built for every pushed commit, to be found at the top of the
release page. Continuous build artifacts are not fully tested and in most cases they are work in progress,
so use them with caution.

## Linux

### AppImage
To use AppImages, make them executable and run them, no installation required.
`$ chmod a+x ksnip*.AppImage`
`$ ./ksnip*.AppImage`

More info about setting to executable can be found [here](https://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-make-an-appimage-executable/80).

### RPM
Just install them via RPM and use.
```
$ rpm -Uvh ksnip*.rpm
$ ksnip
```

### DEB
Just install them via dpkg and start using.
```
$ sudo dpkg -i ksnip*.deb
$ ksnip
```

### APT

Starting with Ubuntu 21.04 Hirsute Hippo, you can install from the [official package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ksnip):
```
$ sudo apt install ksnip
```

For older Ubuntu versions, you can use [@nemonein](https://github.com/nemonein)'s unofficial [PPA](url):
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nemonein/ksnip
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ksnip
```

### Archlinux
Ksnip is in the [Community repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/ksnip/), so you can install it directly via pacman.
```
$ sudo pacman -S ksnip
```

If you want to build from the GIT repository, you can use the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ksnip-git/) (make sure you build the necessary dependencies too).
```
$ yay -S ksnip-git kimageannotator-git kcolorpicker-git
```

### Snap
The usual method for Snaps, will install the latest version:
```
$ sudo snap install ksnip
```

The continuous build version is also available as edge, in order to install it you need to provide the edge flag:
```
$ sudo snap install ksnip --edge
```

Snap startup time can be sped up and console output cleaned up from following error `Could not create AF_NETLINK socket (Permission denied)` by running the following commands:
```
$ snap connect ksnip:network-observe
$ snap connect ksnip:network-manager-observe
```

If you need to save screenshots to a removable media, the following additional connection is required:
```
$ snap connect ksnip:removable-media
```

This only needs to be done once and connects some Snap plugs which are currently not auto-connected.

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/ksnip)

### Flatpak
The usual method for Flatpaks will install the latest version:
```
$ flatpak install flathub org.ksnip.ksnip
```

Then just start it:
```
$ flatpak run org.ksnip.ksnip
```

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.ksnip.ksnip'><img width='220' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png'/></a>

## Windows

### MSI
The MSI installer installs ksnip on your system and is the preferred way for installing ksnip under Windows.

### EXE
The EXE file with all required dependencies comes in a zipped package, which just need to be unzipped
with your favorite unpacking tool. Ksnip can then be started by just double-clicking ksnip.exe.

## macOS

### APP
The app file comes in a DMG package which needs to be opened and the ksnip.app file needs to be dragged
and dropped into the "Application" folder. After that the application can be started by double clicking ksnip.app

### Homebrew Cask
Just install via Homebrew and start using from your "Applications" folder.
```
$ brew install --cask ksnip
```

# Dependencies
ksnip depends on [kImageAnnotator](https://github.com/ksnip/kImageAnnotator) and [kColorPicker](https://github.com/DamirPorobic/kColorPicker) which needs
to be installed before building ksnip from source. Installation instructions can be found on the Github pages.

# Building from source
1. Get latest release from GitHub by cloning the repo:
    `$ git clone https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip`
2. Change to repo directory:
    `$ cd ksnip`
3. Make new build directory and enter it:
    `$ mkdir build && cd build`
4. Create the makefile and build the project:
    `$ cmake .. && make`
5. Now install the application, eventually you need to run it with sudo:
    `$ sudo make install`
6. Run the application:
    `$ ksnip`

If you are using Archlinux, you may prefer to [build ksnip through AUR](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip#archlinux).

# Translations
As with all continuous translations, contributors are always welcome!
For translations [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/ksnip/translations/) is used.

# Known Issues

### X11
1. Snipping area with transparent background doesn't work when compositor is turned off, freeze background is used in that case.

### macOS
1. Snipping area with transparent background doesn't work, freeze background is always used. Issue [#151](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/151)
2. Second activation of snipping area doesn't get focus, you need to switch to the right side in order to see the snipping area. Issue [#152](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/152)
3. Mouse cursor is always captured. Issue [#153](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/153)

### Wayland
1. Portal and Native Screenshots not working under KDE Plasma `>= 5.80`. The issue is coming from a recent change in KDE 
Plasma that prevents access to DBUS Interfaces responsible for taking screenshots. This issue is going to be fixed in 
future Plasma releases for the Portal Screenshots. Workaround for making the Portal Screenshots work is adding the string 
`X-KDE-DBUS-Restricted-Interfaces=org.kde.kwin.Screenshot` to the 
`/usr/share/applications/org.freedesktop.impl.portal.desktop.kde.desktop` file and then restarting. Don't forget to 
enforce Portal screenshots in settings. Issue [#424](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/424)
2. Under Gnome Wayland copying images to clipboard and then pasting them somewhere might not work. This happens currently
with native Wayland. A workaround is using XWayland by starting ksnip like this `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb /usr/bin/ksnip` or
switch to XWayland completely by exporting that variable `export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`. Issue [#416](https://github.com/ksnip/ksnip/issues/416)

# Contribution
Any contribution welcome, be it code, translations or other things. Currently this is needed:
* Write code and fix bugs for macOS.
* Write wiki entries and documentation for ksnip.
* Package ksnip for different operating systems and distros.

# Donation 
ksnip is a non-profitable copylefted libre software project, and still has some costs that need to be covered, like domain costs or hardware costs for cross-platform support.
If you want to help or just want appreciate the work being done by treating developers to a beer or coffee,
you can do that [here](https://www.paypal.me/damirporobic), donations are always welcome :)
