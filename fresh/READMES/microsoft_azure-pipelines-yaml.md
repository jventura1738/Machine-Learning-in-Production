# Azure Pipelines YAML

YAML templates, samples, and community interaction for designing [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/).

We've consolidated issue and suggestion tracking in [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/21/index.html).
This repo will remain for working in the open on YAML pipelines, so feedback on PRs will be the primary way to use it.
You might also want the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops) or to open a [support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/devops/).
