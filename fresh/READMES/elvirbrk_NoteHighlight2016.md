## Format existing text or edit formatted text
1. Select text that you want to format or edit (you can select whole or only part of note). In case part on note is already formatted, you can select whole source code box.
2. From NoteHighlight menu select desired language
3. NoteHighlight form will open with selected text
4. Edit text or change formatting same as for new code

# Additional languages
1. Go to installation folder and find file ribbon.xml and open it with text editor <br />
Default installation folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\CodingRoad\NoteHighlight2016\ or C:\Program Files\CodingRoad\NoteHighlight2016\
2. Edit property "visible" from "false" to "true" for languages that you want to use. It is necessary to restart OneNote for changes to take effect

It is also possible to add new languages (supported by highlight tool) by adding new rows to ribbon.xml but if you need new language then you are smart enough to figure it out :)
