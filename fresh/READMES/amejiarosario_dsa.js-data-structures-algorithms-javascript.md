## Installation

You can clone the repo or install the code from NPM:

```sh
npm install dsa.js
```

and then you can import it into your programs or CLI

```js
const { LinkedList, Queue, Stack } = require('dsa.js');
```

For a list of all available data structures and algorithms, [see index.js](src/index.js).


## Features

Algorithms are an essential toolbox for every programmer.

You will need to mind algorithms runtime when you have to sort data, search for a value in a big dataset, transform data, scale your code to many users, to name a few.
Algorithms are just the step you follow to solve a problem, while data structures are where you store the data for later manipulation. Both combined create programs.

> Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.

Most programming languages and libraries indeed provide implementations for basic data structures and algorithms.
However, to make use of data structures properly, you have to know the tradeoffs to choose the best tool for the job.

This material is going to teach you to:

- üõ† Apply strategies to tackle algorithm questions. Never to get stuck again. Ace those interviews!
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Construct efficient algorithms. Learn how to break down problems into manageable pieces.
- üß† Improve your problem-solving skills and become a well-rounded developer by understanding fundamental computer science concepts.
- ü§ì Cover essential topics, such as big O time, data structures, and must-know algorithms. Implement 10+ data structures from scratch.

## What's Inside

All the code and explanations are available on this repo. You can dig through the links and code examples from the ([src folder](src)). However, the inline code examples are not expanded (because of Github's asciidoc limitations), but you can follow the path and see the implementation.

_Note: If you prefer to consume the information more linearly, then the [book format](https://books.adrianmejia.com/dsajs-data-structures-algorithms-javascript/) would be more appropriate for you._

The topics are divided into four main categories, as you can see below:

#### [When to use an Array or Linked List. Know the tradeoffs](book/content/part02/array-vs-list-vs-queue-vs-stack.asc)

Use Arrays when‚Ä¶
- You need to access data in random order fast (using an index).
- Your data is multi-dimensional (e.g., matrix, tensor).

Use Linked Lists when:
- You will access your data sequentially.
- You want to save memory and only allocate memory as you need it.
- You want constant time to remove/add from extremes of the list.
- when size requirement is unknown - dynamic size advantage

Also, [learn the difference between the different Maps implementations](book/content/part03/time-complexity-graph-data-structures.asc):

- `HashMap` is more time-efficient. A `TreeMap` is more space-efficient.
- `TreeMap` search complexity is *O(log n)*, while an optimized `HashMap` is *O(1)* on average.
- `HashMap`‚Äôs keys are in insertion order (or random depending on the implementation). `TreeMap`‚Äôs keys are always sorted.
- `TreeMap` offers some statistical data for free such as: get minimum, get maximum, median, find ranges of keys. `HashMap` doesn‚Äôt.
- `TreeMap` has a guarantee always an *O(log n)*, while `HashMap`s has an amortized time of *O(1)* but in the rare case of a rehash, it would take an *O(n)*.

#### [Learn different approaches to solve algorithmic problems](book/part04-algorithmic-toolbox.asc)

We are going to discuss the following techniques for solving algorithms problems:
- [Greedy Algorithms](book/content/part04/greedy-algorithms.asc): makes greedy choices using heuristics to find the best solution without looking back.
- [Dynamic Programming](book/content/part04/dynamic-programming.asc): a technique for speeding up recursive algorithms when there are many _overlapping subproblems_. It uses _memoization_ to avoid duplicating work.
- [Divide and Conquer](book/content/part04/divide-and-conquer.asc): _divide_ problems into smaller pieces, _conquer_ each subproblem, and then _join_ the results.
- [Backtracking](book/content/part04/backtracking.asc): search _all (or some)_ possible paths. However, it stops, and _go back_ as soon as notice the current solution is not working.
- _Brute Force_: generate all possible solutions and tries all of them. (Use it as a last resort or as the starting point).

## FAQ

<details>
    <summary>How would I apply these to my day-to-day work? <i>(Click to expand)</i></summary>
    <p>
    As a programmer, we have to solve problems every day. If you want to solve problems well, it's good to know about a broad range of solutions. Often, it's more efficient to learn existing resources than stumble upon the answer yourself. The more tools and practice you have, the better. This book helps you understand the tradeoffs among data structures and reason about algorithms performance.
