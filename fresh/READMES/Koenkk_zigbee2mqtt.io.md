# Zigbee2MQTT.io
This repository contains the Zigbee2MQTT documentation.

## Generated documentation

Due to the repetitive nature of zigbee devices, lots of documentation is auto-generated from source code or by particular directives for the `exposes` and `notes` section. For local development:

```bash
npm install
npm run docgen
```

## Running locally
To run locally, execute the following commands:

```bash
