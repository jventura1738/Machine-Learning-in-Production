This repo is a companion repo to the main [flutter
repo](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). It contains the source code for
Flutter first-party plugins (i.e., plugins developed by the core Flutter team).
Check the `packages` directory for all plugins.

Flutter plugins enable access to platform-specific APIs. For more information
about plugins, and how to use them, see
[https://flutter.dev/platform-plugins/](https://flutter.dev/platform-plugins/).

These plugins are also available on
[pub](https://pub.dev/flutter/packages).
