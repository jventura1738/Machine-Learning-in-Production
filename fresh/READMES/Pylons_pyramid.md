`Pyramid <https://trypyramid.com/>`_ is a small, fast, down-to-earth, open
source Python web framework. It makes real-world web application development
and deployment more fun, more predictable, and more productive.

.. code-block:: python

    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    from pyramid.config import Configurator
    from pyramid.response import Response

    def hello_world(request):
        return Response('Hello World!')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with Configurator() as config:
            config.add_route('hello', '/')
            config.add_view(hello_world, route_name='hello')
            app = config.make_wsgi_app()
        server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 6543, app)
        server.serve_forever()
