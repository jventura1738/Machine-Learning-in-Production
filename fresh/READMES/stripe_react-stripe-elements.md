## We’ve moved to [@stripe/react-stripe-js](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js)!

We have decided to rename, rework, and move this project. We have no plans for
any additional major releases of `react-stripe-elements`. If you have an issue with this package, please open it on the [react-stripe-js repo](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js).

If you are starting a new Stripe integration or are looking to update your
existing integration, use
[React Stripe.js](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js).

> React components for Stripe.js and Stripe Elements

This project is a thin React wrapper around
[Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js) and
[Stripe Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/elements). It allows you to add
Elements to any React app, and manages the state and lifecycle of Elements for
you.

The
[Stripe.js / Stripe Elements API reference](https://stripe.com/docs/elements/reference)
goes into more detail on the various customization options for Elements (e.g.
styles, fonts).

## Installation

### First, install `react-stripe-elements`.

Install with `yarn`:

```
yarn add react-stripe-elements
```

OR with `npm`:

```
npm install --save react-stripe-elements
```

OR using UMD build (exports a global `ReactStripeElements` object);

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-stripe-elements@latest/dist/react-stripe-elements.min.js"></script>
```

### Then, load Stripe.js in your application:

```html
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
```

## Getting started

### The Stripe context (`StripeProvider`)

In order for your application to have access to
[the Stripe object](https://stripe.com/docs/elements/reference#the-stripe-object),
let's add `StripeProvider` to our root React App component:

```jsx
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import {StripeProvider} from 'react-stripe-elements';

import MyStoreCheckout from './MyStoreCheckout';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <StripeProvider apiKey="pk_test_12345">
      <MyStoreCheckout />
    </StripeProvider>
  );
};

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Element groups (`Elements`)

Next, when you're building components for your checkout form, you'll want to
wrap the `Elements` component around your `form`. This groups the set of Stripe
Elements you're using together, so that we're able to pull data from groups of
Elements when you're tokenizing.

```jsx
// MyStoreCheckout.js
import React from 'react';
import {Elements} from 'react-stripe-elements';

import InjectedCheckoutForm from './CheckoutForm';

class MyStoreCheckout extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Elements>
        <InjectedCheckoutForm />
      </Elements>
    );
  }
}

export default MyStoreCheckout;
```

### Setting up your payment form (`injectStripe`)

Use the `injectStripe` [Higher-Order Component][hoc] (HOC) to build your payment
form components in the `Elements` tree. The [Higher-Order Component][hoc]
pattern in React can be unfamiliar to those who've never seen it before, so
consider reading up before continuing. The `injectStripe` HOC provides the
`this.props.stripe` and `this.props.elements` properties that manage your
`Elements` groups. Within an injected component, you can call any of the methods
on the [Stripe][stripe] or [Elements][elements] objects.

[hoc]: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html
[stripe]: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#the-stripe-object
[elements]: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#the-elements-object

> :warning: NOTE `injectStripe` cannot be used on the same element that renders
> the `Elements` component; it must be used on the child component of
> `Elements`. `injectStripe` _returns a wrapped component_ that needs to sit
> under `<Elements>` but above any code where you'd like to access
> `this.props.stripe`.

```jsx
// CheckoutForm.js
import React from 'react';
import {injectStripe} from 'react-stripe-elements';

import AddressSection from './AddressSection';
import CardSection from './CardSection';

class CheckoutForm extends React.Component {
  handleSubmit = (ev) => {
    // We don't want to let default form submission happen here, which would refresh the page.
    ev.preventDefault();

    // Use Elements to get a reference to the Card Element mounted somewhere
    // in your <Elements> tree. Elements will know how to find your Card Element
    // because only one is allowed.
    // See our getElement documentation for more:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#elements-get-element
    const cardElement = this.props.elements.getElement('card');

    // From here we can call createPaymentMethod to create a PaymentMethod
    // See our createPaymentMethod documentation for more:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-create-payment-method
    this.props.stripe
      .createPaymentMethod({
        type: 'card',
        card: cardElement,
        billing_details: {name: 'Jenny Rosen'},
      })
      .then(({paymentMethod}) => {
        console.log('Received Stripe PaymentMethod:', paymentMethod);
      });

    // You can also use confirmCardPayment with the PaymentIntents API automatic confirmation flow.
    // See our confirmCardPayment documentation for more:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-confirm-card-payment
    this.props.stripe.confirmCardPayment('{PAYMENT_INTENT_CLIENT_SECRET}', {
      payment_method: {
        card: cardElement,
      },
    });

    // You can also use confirmCardSetup with the SetupIntents API.
    // See our confirmCardSetup documentation for more:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-confirm-card-setup
    this.props.stripe.confirmCardSetup('{PAYMENT_INTENT_CLIENT_SECRET}', {
      payment_method: {
        card: cardElement,
      },
    });

    // You can also use createToken to create tokens.
    // See our tokens documentation for more:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-create-token
    // With createToken, you will not need to pass in the reference to
    // the Element. It will be inferred automatically.
    this.props.stripe.createToken({type: 'card', name: 'Jenny Rosen'});
    // token type can optionally be inferred if there is only one Element
    // with which to create tokens
    // this.props.stripe.createToken({name: 'Jenny Rosen'});

    // You can also use createSource to create Sources.
    // See our Sources documentation for more:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-create-source
    // With createSource, you will not need to pass in the reference to
    // the Element. It will be inferred automatically.
    this.props.stripe.createSource({
      type: 'card',
      owner: {
        name: 'Jenny Rosen',
      },
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <AddressSection />
        <CardSection />
        <button>Confirm order</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default injectStripe(CheckoutForm);
```

### Using individual `*Element` components

Now, you can use individual `*Element` components, such as `CardElement`, to
build your form.

```jsx
// CardSection.js
import React from 'react';
import {CardElement} from 'react-stripe-elements';

class CardSection extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <label>
        Card details
        <CardElement style={{base: {fontSize: '18px'}}} />
      </label>
    );
  }
}

export default CardSection;
```

### Using the `PaymentRequestButtonElement`

The
[Payment Request Button](https://stripe.com/docs/elements/payment-request-button)
lets you collect payment and address information from your customers using Apple
Pay and the Payment Request API.

To use the `PaymentRequestButtonElement` you need to first create a
[`PaymentRequest` object](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js#the-payment-request-object).
You can then conditionally render the `PaymentRequestButtonElement` based on the
result of `paymentRequest.canMakePayment` and pass the `PaymentRequest` Object
as a prop.

```jsx
class PaymentRequestForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    // For full documentation of the available paymentRequest options, see:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js#the-payment-request-object
    const paymentRequest = props.stripe.paymentRequest({
      country: 'US',
      currency: 'usd',
      total: {
        label: 'Demo total',
        amount: 1000,
      },
    });

    paymentRequest.on('token', ({complete, token, ...data}) => {
      console.log('Received Stripe token: ', token);
      console.log('Received customer information: ', data);
      complete('success');
    });

    paymentRequest.canMakePayment().then((result) => {
      this.setState({canMakePayment: !!result});
    });

    this.state = {
      canMakePayment: false,
      paymentRequest,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return this.state.canMakePayment ? (
      <PaymentRequestButtonElement
        paymentRequest={this.state.paymentRequest}
        className="PaymentRequestButton"
        style={{
          // For more details on how to style the Payment Request Button, see:
          // https://stripe.com/docs/elements/payment-request-button#styling-the-element
          paymentRequestButton: {
            theme: 'light',
            height: '64px',
          },
        }}
      />
    ) : null;
  }
}
export default injectStripe(PaymentRequestForm);
```

## Advanced integrations

The above [Getting started](#getting-started) section outlines the most common
integration, which makes the following assumptions:

- The Stripe.js script is loaded before your application's code.
- Your code is only run in a browser environment.
- You don't need fine-grained control over the Stripe instance that
  `react-stripe-elements` uses under the hood.

When all of these assumptions are true, you can pass the `apiKey` prop to
`<StripeProvider>` and let `react-stripe-elements` handle the rest.

When one or more of these assumptions doesn't hold true for your integration,
you have another option: pass a Stripe instance as the `stripe` prop to
`<StripeProvider>` directly. The `stripe` prop can be either `null` or the
result of using `Stripe(apiKey, options)` to construct a [Stripe instance].

[stripe-function]: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-function

We'll now cover a couple of use cases which break at least one of the
assumptions listed above.

### Loading Stripe.js asynchronously

Loading Stripe.js asynchronously can speed up your initial page load, especially
if you don't show the payment form until the user interacts with your
application in some way.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- ... -->

    <!-- Note the 'id' and 'async' attributes:                         -->
    <!--    ┌────────────┐                                 ┌───┐       -->
    <script id="stripe-js" src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/" async></script>

    <!-- ... -->
  </head>
  <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

Initialize `this.state.stripe` to `null` in the `constructor`, then update it in
`componentDidMount` when the script tag has loaded.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {stripe: null};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    if (window.Stripe) {
      this.setState({stripe: window.Stripe('pk_test_12345')});
    } else {
      document.querySelector('#stripe-js').addEventListener('load', () => {
        // Create Stripe instance once Stripe.js loads
        this.setState({stripe: window.Stripe('pk_test_12345')});
      });
    }
  }
  render() {
    // this.state.stripe will either be null or a Stripe instance
    // depending on whether Stripe.js has loaded.
    return (
      <StripeProvider stripe={this.state.stripe}>
        <Elements>
          <InjectedCheckoutForm />
        </Elements>
      </StripeProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

When loading Stripe.js asynchronously, the `stripe` prop provided by
`injectStripe` will initially be `null`, and will update to the Stripe instance
once you pass it in to your `StripeProvider`. You can find a working demo of
this strategy in [async.js](demo/async/async.js). If you run the demo locally,
you can view it at <http://localhost:8080/async/>.

For alternatives to calling `setState`in `componentDidMount`, consider using a
`setTimeout()`, moving the `if/else` statement to the `constructor`, or
dynamically injecting a script tag in `componentDidMount`. For more information,
see [stripe/react-stripe-elements][issue-154].

[issue-154]: https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-elements/issues/154

### Server-side rendering (SSR)

If you're using `react-stripe-elements` in a non-browser environment
(`React.renderToString`, etc.), Stripe.js is not available. To use
`react-stripe-elements` with SSR frameworks, use the following instructions.

The general idea is similar to the async loading snippet from the previous
section (initialize `this.state.stripe` to `null` in `constructor`, update in
`componentDidMount`), but this time we don't have to wait for the script tag to
load in `componentDidMount`; we can use `window.Stripe` directly.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {stripe: null};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    // Create Stripe instance in componentDidMount
    // (componentDidMount only fires in browser/DOM environment)
    this.setState({stripe: window.Stripe('pk_test_12345')});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <StripeProvider stripe={this.state.stripe}>
        <Elements>
          <InjectedCheckoutForm />
        </Elements>
      </StripeProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

Inside your form, `<InjectedCheckoutForm />`, `this.props.stripe` will either be
`null` or a valid Stripe instance. This means that it will be `null` when
rendered server-side, but set when rendered in a browser.

### Using an existing Stripe instance

In some projects, part of the project uses React, while another part doesn't.
For example, maybe you have business logic and view logic separate. Or maybe you
use `react-stripe-elements` for your credit card form, but use Stripe.js APIs
directly for tokenizing bank account information.

You can use the `stripe` prop to get more fine-grained control over the Stripe
instance that `<StripeProvider>` uses. For example, if you have a `stripe`
instance in a Redux store that you pass to your `<App />` as a prop, you can
pass that instance directly into `<StripeProvider>`:

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <StripeProvider stripe={this.props.stripe}>
        <Elements>
          <InjectedCheckoutForm />
        </Elements>
      </StripeProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

As long as `<App />` is provided a non-`null` `stripe` prop, `this.props.stripe`
will always be available within your `InjectedCheckoutForm`.

## Component reference

### `<StripeProvider>`

All applications using `react-stripe-elements` must use the `<StripeProvider>`
component, which sets up the Stripe context for a component tree.
`react-stripe-elements` uses the provider pattern (which is also adopted by
tools like [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and
[`react-intl`](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl)) to scope a Stripe context
to a tree of components.

This allows configuration like your API key to be provided at the root of a
component tree. This context is then made available to the `<Elements>`
component and individual `<*Element>` components that we provide.

An integration usually wraps the `<StripeProvider>` around the application’s
root component. This way, your entire application has the configured Stripe
context.

#### Props shape

There are two _distinct_ props shapes you can pass to `<StripeProvider>`.

```jsx
type StripeProviderProps =
  | {apiKey: string, ...}
  | {stripe: StripeObject | null};
```

See [Advanced integrations](#advanced-integrations) for more information on when
to use each.

The `...` above represents that this component accepts props for any option that
can be passed into `Stripe(apiKey, options)`. For example, if you are using
[Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) and want to act on behalf of a
connected account, you can pass `stripeAccount="acct_123"` as a property to
`<StripeProvider>`. This will get used just like passing `stripeAccount` in the
options of the `Stripe` constructor or like using `stripe_account` when your
backend calls the Stripe API directly

### `<Elements>`

The `Elements` component wraps groups of Elements that belong together. In most
cases, you want to wrap this around your checkout form.

#### Props shape

This component accepts all `options` that can be passed into
`stripe.elements(options)` as props.

```jsx
type ElementsProps = {
  locale?: string,
  fonts?: Array<Object>,
  // The full specification for `elements()` options is here: https://stripe.com/docs/elements/reference#elements-options
};
```

### `<*Element>` components

These components display the UI for Elements, and must be used within
`StripeProvider` and `Elements`.

#### Available components

(More to come!)

- `CardElement`
- `CardNumberElement`
- `CardExpiryElement`
- `CardCvcElement`
- `PaymentRequestButtonElement`
- `IbanElement`
- `IdealBankElement`

#### Props shape

These components accept all `options` that can be passed into
`elements.create(type, options)` as props.

```jsx
type ElementProps = {
  id?: string,
  className?: string,

  // For full documentation on the events and payloads below, see:
  // https://stripe.com/docs/elements/reference#element-on
  onBlur?: () => void,
  onChange?: (changeObject: Object) => void,
  onFocus?: () => void,
  onReady?: (StripeElement) => void,
};
```

The props for the `PaymentRequestButtonElement` are:

```jsx
type PaymentRequestButtonProps = {
  id?: string,
  className?: string,

  paymentRequest: StripePaymentRequest,

  onBlur?: () => void,
  onClick?: () => void,
  onFocus?: () => void,
  onReady?: (StripeElement) => void,
};
```

#### Using `onReady`

Note that the `onReady` callback gives you access to the underlying [Element]
created with Stripe.js. You can use this to get access to all the underlying
methods that a Stripe Element supports.

For example, you can use `onReady` to force your element to focus:

```jsx
// CardSection.js
import React from 'react';
import {CardElement} from 'react-stripe-elements';

class CardSection extends React.Component {
  render = () => {
    return (
      <label>
        Card details
        <CardElement onReady={(el) => el.focus()} />
      </label>
    );
  };
}

export default CardSection;
```

(Note that this functionality is new as of react-stripe-elements v1.6.0.)

[element]: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#other-methods

### `injectStripe` HOC

```jsx
function injectStripe(
  WrappedComponent: ReactClass,
  options?: {
    withRef?: boolean = false,
  }
): ReactClass;
```

Use `injectStripe` to wrap a component that needs to interact with `Stripe.js`
to create sources or tokens.

1.  First, create a component that accepts the `stripe` prop and calls one of
    the Stripe or Elements methods when necessary.
2.  Wrap that component by passing it to `injectStripe` so that it actually
    receives the `stripe` and `elements` props.
3.  Render the component that `injectStripe` returns.

#### Example

```jsx
// 1. Create a component that uses this.props.stripe:
class CheckoutForm extends React.Component {
  render() {
    /* ... */
  }
  onCompleteCheckout() {
    this.props.stripe
      .createPaymentMethod({
        type: 'card',
        card: this.props.stripe.getElement('card'),
      })
      .then(/* ... */);
  }
}

// 2. Wrap it in a higher-order component that provides the `stripe` prop:
const InjectedCheckoutForm = injectStripe(CheckoutForm);

// 3. Render the wrapped component in your app:
const CheckoutRoute = (props) => (
  <div>
    <InjectedCheckoutForm />
  </div>
);
```

`injectStripe` will work with any method of providing the actual Stripe instance
with `StripeProvider`, whether you just give it an api key,
[load Stripe.js asynchronously](#loading-stripejs-asynchronously), or
[pass in an existing instance](#using-an-existing-stripe-instance).

Within the context of `Elements`, `stripe.createToken` and `stripe.createSource`
wrap methods of the same name in
[Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference#stripe-create-Token).
Calls to them automatically infer and pass the `Element` object as the first
argument.

If the `withRef` option is set to `true`, the wrapped component instance will be
available with the `getWrappedInstance()` method of the wrapper component. This
feature can not be used if the wrapped component is a stateless function
component.

Within the wrapped component, the `stripe` and `elements` props have the type:

```jsx
type FactoryProps = {
  elements: null | {
    getElement: (type: string) => Element | null,
    // For more detail and documentation on other methods available on
    // the `elements` object, please refer to our official documentation:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/elements/reference#the-elements-object
  },
  stripe: null | {
    createToken: (tokenData: {type?: string}) => Promise<{
      token?: Object,
      error?: Object,
    }>,
    createSource: (sourceData: {type: string}) => Promise<{
      source?: Object,
      error?: Object,
    }>,
    createPaymentMethod: (
      paymentMethodData: Object
    ) => Promise<{
      paymentMethod?: Object,
      error?: Object,
    }>,
    confirmCardPayment: (
      clientSecret: string,
      paymentIntentData?: Object
    ) => Promise<{
      paymentIntent?: Object,
      error?: Object,
    }>,
    confirmCardSetup: (
      clientSecret: string,
      paymentIntentData?: Object
    ) => Promise<{
      setupIntent?: Object,
      error?: Object,
    }>,
    // For more detail and documentation on other methods available on
    // the `stripe` object, please refer to our official documentation:
    // https://stripe.com/docs/elements/reference#the-stripe-object
  },
};
```

The `stripe` and `elements` props can only be `null` if you are using one of the
[Advanced integrations](#advanced-integrations) mentioned above, like loading
Stripe.js asynchronously or providing an existing instance. If you are using a
basic integration where you pass in an api key to `<StripeProvider/>`, they will

## Troubleshooting

`react-stripe-elements` may not work properly when used with components that
implement `shouldComponentUpdate`. `react-stripe-elements` relies heavily on
React's `context` feature and `shouldComponentUpdate` does not provide a way to
take context updates into account when deciding whether to allow a re-render.
These components can block context updates from reaching `react-stripe-element`
components in the tree.

For example, when using `react-stripe-elements` together with
[`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) doing the following will
not work:

```jsx
const Component = connect()(injectStripe(_Component));
```

In this case, the context updates originating from the `StripeProvider` are not
reaching the components wrapped inside the `connect` function. Therefore,
`react-stripe-elements` components deeper in the tree break. The reason is that
the `connect` function of `react-redux`
[implements `shouldComponentUpdate`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#my-views-arent-updating-when-something-changes-outside-of-redux)
and blocks re-renders that are triggered by context changes outside of the
connected component.

There are two ways to prevent this issue:

1.  Change the order of the functions to have `injectStripe` be the outermost
    one:

    ```jsx
    const Component = injectStripe(connect()(_CardForm));
    ```

This works, because `injectStripe` does not implement `shouldComponentUpdate`
itself, so context updates originating from the `redux` `Provider` will still
reach all components.

2.  You can use the [`pure: false`][pure-false] option for redux-connect:

    ```jsx
    const Component = connect(
      mapStateToProps,
      mapDispatchToProps,
      mergeProps,
      {
        pure: false,
      }
    )(injectStripe(_CardForm));
    ```
