### Legacy info
Keka started in [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/keka) as an open source project. Since 1.0 is a closed code project ([one of the reasons](http://web.archive.org/web/20180615184129/http://trac.keka.io/ticket/14)) and there're no plans to open the code again.

Thanks to [NETWORKREDUX](https://networkredux.com) and [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org) the project gained its own ticketing system. Is now defunct because NETWORKREDUX deleted the server without prior notice so no backup was made.
