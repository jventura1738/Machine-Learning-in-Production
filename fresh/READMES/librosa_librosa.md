Documentation
-------------
See https://librosa.org/doc/ for a complete reference manual and introductory tutorials.

The [advanced example gallery](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/advanced.html) should give you a quick sense of the kinds
of things that librosa can do.

Installation
------------

The latest stable release is available on PyPI, and you can install it by saying
```
pip install librosa
```

Anaconda users can install using ``conda-forge``:
```
conda install -c conda-forge librosa
```

To build librosa from source, say `python setup.py build`.
Then, to install librosa, say `python setup.py install`.
If all went well, you should be able to execute the demo scripts under `examples/`
(OS X users should follow the installation guide given below).

Alternatively, you can download or clone the repository and use `pip` to handle dependencies:

```
unzip librosa.zip
pip install -e librosa
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/librosa/librosa.git
pip install -e librosa
```

By calling `pip list` you should see `librosa` now as an installed package:
```
librosa (0.x.x, /path/to/librosa)
```

### Hints for the Installation

`librosa` uses `soundfile` and `audioread` to load audio files.
Note that `soundfile` does not currently support MP3, which will cause librosa to
fall back on the `audioread` library.

#### soundfile

If you're using `conda` to install librosa, then most audio coding dependencies (except MP3) will be handled automatically.

If you're using `pip` on a Linux environment, you may need to install `libsndfile`
manually.  Please refer to the [SoundFile installation documentation](https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/#installation) for details.

#### audioread and MP3 support

To fuel `audioread` with more audio-decoding power (e.g., for reading MP3 files),
you may need to install either *ffmpeg* or *GStreamer*.

*Note that on some platforms, `audioread` needs at least one of the programs to work properly.*

If you are using Anaconda, install *ffmpeg* by calling
```
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
```

If you are not using Anaconda, here are some common commands for different operating systems:

* Linux (apt-get): `apt-get install ffmpeg` or `apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`
* Linux (yum): `yum install ffmpeg` or `yum install gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`
* Mac: `brew install ffmpeg` or `brew install gstreamer`
* Windows: download ffmpeg binaries from this [website](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) or gstreamer binaries from this [website](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)

For GStreamer, you also need to install the Python bindings with 
```
pip install pygobject
```
