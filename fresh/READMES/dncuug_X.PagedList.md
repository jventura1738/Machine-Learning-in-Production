# X.PagedList
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vlbd5ei5l7keyui9?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ernado-x/x-pagedlist)

## What is this?
This is fork of Troy's project [PagedList](https://github.com/troygoode/PagedList).
The main difference is that X.PagedList is a portable assembly. It means you can use it not only in Web projects but also in Winforms, WPF, Window Phone, Silverlight and other .NET projects.

PagedList is a library that enables you to easily take an IEnumerable/IQueryable, chop it up into "pages", and grab a specific "page" by an index. PagedList.Mvc allows you to take that "page" and display a pager control that has links like "Previous", "Next", etc.

## How to use
You can find all information about how to use X.PagedList libraries in [Wiki](https://github.com/dncuug/X.PagedList/wiki)
