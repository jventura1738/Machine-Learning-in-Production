## 2. Why is it called ZenTao?

Zen(禅) and Tao(道) are the two Chinese characters that have rich meanings in both religion and culture. ZenTao Project Management Software takes the cultural meaning of Zen and Tao, and is expected to convey our understanding and thinking of management. Inspired by The Tao of Programming and The Zen of Programming, we named our software ZenTao.

## 3. Design philosophy of ZenTao Project Management Software

The main design philosophy of ZenTao Project Management Software is based on Scrum, an internationally popular Agile methodology. Scrum is very pragmatic and easy to operate, so it fits in the fast iterative development of software projects. However, Scrum only defines the core management framework. There are still many details and processes that have to be extended and developed. Based on the philosophy of Scrum and with the observation of the current development situations in China, ZenTao integrates bug management, test case management, release management and document management, and it completely covers the entire lifecycle of software development. In ZenTao, the concepts of product, project and test are clearly defined. Product team, development team and QA team coordinate and check with each other while they function differently. The three teams interact with each other through stories, tasks and bugs, and eventually deliver the product with quality.
