We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## How it works

Our own [Freek Van der Herten](https://twitter.com/freekmurze) gave a talk on the dashboard at Laracon EU where he explained how the dashboard works behind the screens. The talk was recorded and published [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtB_rTh61Zo).

## Installation

Install this package by running cloning this repository and install like you normally install Laravel.

- Run `composer install` and `npm install yarn`
- Run `yarn` and `yarn run dev` to generate assets
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill your values (`php artisan key:generate`, database, pusher values etc)
- Run `php artisan migrate --seed`, this will seed a user based on your `BASIC_AUTH` `.env` values
- Start your queue listener and setup the Laravel scheduler.
- Open the dashboard in your browser, login and wait for the update events to fill the dashboard.

## Postcardware

If you are using our dashboard, please send us a postcard from your hometown.

Our address is: Spatie, Kruikstraat 22, 2018 Antwerp, Belgium.
