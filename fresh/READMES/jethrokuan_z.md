# Z

**z** is a port of [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com).

**z** tracks the directories you visit. With a combination of frequency and recency, it enables you to jump to the directory in mind.

A _pure-fish_ port means **z** is _fast_ and _fish-friendly_, with tab-completions and lazy-loading. Top that off with great customizability and a small amount of added functionality.
