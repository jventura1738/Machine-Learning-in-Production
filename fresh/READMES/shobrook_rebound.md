## Installation

>Requires Python 3.0 or higher.

Rebound works on MacOS, Linux, and Windows (if you use Cygwin). You can install it with pip:

`$ pip install rebound-cli`

or apt-get if you're using Linux:

`$ sudo apt-get install rebound-cli`

## Usage

Running a file with `rebound` is just as easy as running it normally:

This will execute the file, pull the error message, and let you browse related Stack Overflow questions and answers without leaving the terminal.

__Supported file types:__ Python, Node.js, Ruby, Golang, and Java.
