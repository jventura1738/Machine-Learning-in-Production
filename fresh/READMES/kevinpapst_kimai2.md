## Roadmap and releases

You can see a rough development roadmap in the [Milestones](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/milestones) sections.
It is open for changes and input from the community, your [ideas and questions](https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/issues) are welcome.

> Kimai 2 uses a rolling release concept for delivering updates.
> You can upgrade Kimai at any time, you don't need to wait for the next official release.
> The master branch is always deployable, release tags are only snapshots of the current development version.

Release versions will be created on a regular base (approx. one release every 2 months).
Every code change, whether it's a new feature or a bugfix, will be done on the master branch. 
Kimai is actively developed in my spare time, I put my effort into the software instead of backporting changes.
