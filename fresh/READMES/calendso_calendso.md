<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img width="937" alt="calendso-screenshot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8019099/117973912-d9405a80-b324-11eb-8b35-4262e472909c.png">

Let's face it: Calendly and other scheduling tools are awesome. It made our lives massively easier. We're using it for business meetings, seminars, yoga classes and even calls with our families. However, most tools are very limited in terms of control and customisations. That's where Calendso comes in. Self-hosted or hosted by us. White-label by design. API-driven and ready to be deployed on your own domain. Full control of your events and data. Calendso is to Calendly what GitLab is to GitHub.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Here is what you need to be able to run Calendso.
* Node.js
* PostgreSQL
* Yarn _(recommended)_

You will also need Google API credentials. You can get this from the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard). More details on this can be found below under the [Obtaining the Google API Credentials section](#Obtaining-the-Google-API-Credentials).

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/calendso/calendso.git
   ```
2. Install packages with yarn
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. Configure environment variables in the .env file. Replace `<user>`, `<pass>`, `<db-host>`, `<db-port>` with their applicable values
   ```
   DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<db-host>:<db-port>'
   GOOGLE_API_CREDENTIALS='secret'
   ```
   <details>
   <summary>If you don't know how to configure the DATABASE_URL, then follow the steps here</summary>

   1. Create a free account with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

   2. Create a new app.
   <img width="306" alt="Google Chrome — CleanShotX | 2021-04-20 at 02 01 56" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16905768/115322780-b3d58c00-a17e-11eb-8a52-b758fb0ea942.png">

   3. In your new app, go to `Overview` and next to `Installed add-ons`, click `Configure Add-ons`. We need this to set up our database.
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16905768/115323232-a53ba480-a17f-11eb-98db-58e2f8c52426.png)

   4. Once you clicked on `Configure Add-ons`, click on `Find more add-ons` and search for `postgres`. One of the options will be `Heroku Postgres` - click on that option.

   5. Once the pop-up appears, click `Submit Order Form` - plan name should be `Hobby Dev - Free`.
   <img width="512" alt="Google Chrome — CleanShotX | 2021-04-20 at 02 04 29" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16905768/115323265-b4baed80-a17f-11eb-99f0-d67f019aa6df.png">

   6. Once you completed the above steps, click on your newly created `Heroku Postgres` and go to its `Settings`.
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16905768/115323367-e92ea980-a17f-11eb-9ff4-dec95f2ec349.png)

   7. In `Settings`, copy your URI to your Calendso .env file and replace the `postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<db-host>:<db-port>` with it.
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16905768/115323556-4591c900-a180-11eb-9808-2f55d2aa3995.png)
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16905768/115323697-7a9e1b80-a180-11eb-9f08-a742b1037f90.png)

   8. To view your DB, once you add new data in Prisma, you can use [Heroku Data Explorer](https://heroku-data-explorer.herokuapp.com/).
   </details>

5. Set up the database using the Prisma schema (found in `prisma/schema.prisma`)
   ```sh
   npx prisma db push
   ```
6. Run (in development mode)
   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```
7. Open [Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio) to look at or modify the database content:
   ```
   npx prisma studio
   ```
8. Click on the `User` model to add a new user record.
9.  Fill out the fields (remembering to encrypt your password with [BCrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/)) and click `Save 1 Record` to create your first user.
10. Open a browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and login with your just created, first user.

### Upgrading from earlier versions
1. Pull the current version:
   ```
   git pull
   ```
2. Apply database migrations by running <b>one of</b> the following commands:

   In a development environment, run:
   ```
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
   (this can clear your development database in some cases)

   In a production environment, run:
   ```
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
3. Check the `.env.example` and compare it to your current `.env` file. In case there are any fields not present
   in your current `.env`, add them there.

   For the current version, especially check if the variable `BASE_URL` is present and properly set in your environment, for example:
   ```
   BASE_URL='https://yourdomain.com'
   ```
4. Start the server. In a development environment, just do:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```
   For a production build, run for example:
   ```
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```
5. Enjoy the new version.
