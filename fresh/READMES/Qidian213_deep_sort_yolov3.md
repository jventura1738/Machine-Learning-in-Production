注意： 本代码创建时间较为久远，软件版本较老，很多模块功能不够高效，功能简单。 推荐使用别的作者实现的Pytorch版本等。

# Introduction
  Thanks for these projects, this work now is support tiny_yolo v3 but only for test, if you want to train you can either train a model in darknet or in the second following works. It also can tracks many objects in coco classes, so please note to modify the classes in yolo.py. besides, you also can use camera for testing.

# Quick Start

1. Download YOLOv3 or tiny_yolov3 weights from [YOLO website](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).Then convert the Darknet YOLO model to a Keras model. Or use what i had converted https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uvXFacPnrSMw6ldWTyLLjGLETlEsUvcE/view?usp=sharing (yolo.h5 model file with tf-1.4.0) , put it into model_data folder
2. Run YOLO_DEEP_SORT with cmd :
   ```
   python demo.py
   ```

3. (Optional) Convert the Darknet YOLO model to a Keras model by yourself:

  ```
   please download the weights at first from yolo website. 
   python convert.py yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights model_data/yolo.h5
  ```

# Dependencies

  The code is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3. The following dependencies are needed to run the tracker:

    NumPy
    sklean
    OpenCV
    Pillow

  Additionally, feature generation requires TensorFlow-1.4.0.

# Training the model

  To train the deep association metric model on your datasets you can reference to https://github.com/nwojke/cosine_metric_learning  approach which is provided as a separate repository.
  
  Be careful that the code ignores everything but person. For your task do not forget to change :
  
  [deep_sort_yolov3/yolo.py]   Lines 100 to 101 :
  
          if predicted_class != 'person' : 
               continue 

# Note 
  You can use any Detector you like to replace Keras_version YOLO to get bboxes , for it is to slow !
  
  Model file model_data/mars-small128.pb need by deep_sort had convert to tensorflow-1.4.0
  
  Deep sort 程序结构见 “model_data/DeepSORT”，如有错误欢迎联系修改。
 
# Test only

  Speed : when only run yolo detection about 11-13 fps  , after add deep_sort about 11.5 fps (GTX1060 6G)
