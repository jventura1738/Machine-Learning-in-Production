# Introduction

RTK Query is an advanced data fetching and caching tool, designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application. It is built on top of [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and uses Redux internally for its architecture.

## RTK Query was released in Redux Toolkit 1.6

This repo was used for early alpha development, and is now closed.

Please visit the RTK Query live docs at https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview, and see https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit for issues.
