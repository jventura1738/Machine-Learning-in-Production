**WARNING: You're currently looking at our `v2` branch which is still in progress.**

We are currently hard at work trying to release `2.0`. We have a `2.0.0-rc18` prerelease out and we're hoping to finalize this release soon (you can track the progress [here](https://github.com/DoubleSymmetry/react-native-track-player/issues/662)). We do not have a changelog yet we will wrap that up once the release is more stable.

> If you're looking for the readme & examples for `react-native-track-player v1.2.7` - find it on [github](https://github.com/DoubleSymmetry/react-native-track-player/tree/v1.2.7).

## Why another music module?
After trying to team up modules like `react-native-sound`, `react-native-music-controls` and `react-native-google-cast`, I've noticed, that their structure and the way should be tied together can cause a lot of problems (mainly on Android). Those can heavily affect the app stability and user experience.

All audio modules (like `react-native-sound`) don't play in a separated service on Android, which should **only** be used for simple audio tracks in the foreground (such as sound effects, voice messages, etc.)

`react-native-music-controls` is meant for apps using those audio modules, but it has a few problems: the audio isn't tied directly to the controls. It can be pretty useful for casting (such as Chromecast).

`react-native-google-cast` works pretty well and also supports custom receivers, but it has fewer player controls, it's harder to integrate and still uses the Cast SDK v2.

## First Steps

If you want to get started with this module, check the [Getting Started](https://react-native-track-player.js.org/getting-started/) page.

If you want detailed information about the API, check the [Documentation](https://react-native-track-player.js.org/documentation/). You can also look at our example project [here](/example).

## Example

A basic example of how to play a track:

```javascript
import TrackPlayer from 'react-native-track-player';

const start = async () => {
    // Set up the player
    await TrackPlayer.setupPlayer();

    // Add a track to the queue
    await TrackPlayer.add({
        id: 'trackId',
        url: require('track.mp3'),
        title: 'Track Title',
        artist: 'Track Artist',
        artwork: require('track.png')
    });

    // Start playing it
    await TrackPlayer.play();
};
start();
```
