# Ghygen
__Ghygen__ is a GitHub actions Yaml Generator.

__Ghygen__ allows you creating your __Yaml__ file for __GitHub Actions__, for Laravel/PHP web application,  so you can:

- select triggering events: manually or automatically, when the developer _push_ the code on a specific branch, or a developer create a new _Pull Request_;
- select branches;
- enable caching for all vendors;
- enable __caching__ PHP packages;
- select __multiple__ PHP versions (8.0, 7.4, 7.3);
- select __multiple Laravel__ versions (8, 7, 6), useful if you are developing a Laravel Package and you want to test it with multiple Laravel version;
- select __Node__ version for NPM (npm run something);
- caching node packages;
- setup __Mysql__ Database service;
- setup __PostgreSQL__ Database service;
- setup __Sqlite__ in memory database;
- run migrations;
- __execute tests__ via phpunit;
- static __code analysis__ with phpstan or psalm; 
- code sniffer (via phpcs for __PSR12__ compatibility);
- __validate Yaml__ file;
- execute __Browser Test__ via Laravel Dusk.
- Run __Deployments__ via Ploi using [Ploi Deploy Action](https://github.com/Glennmen/ploi-deploy-action).

This is a Work In Progress, we are adding new features...

If you want to test and use quickly this tool, I deployed the codebase (main branch) on Digital Ocean Platform:

- [Ghygen Demo](https://ghygen.hi-folks.dev/).

If you want to start using it locally you can clone the repo and install it following the instructions below.

## Install
Clone source code, enter the new directory and perform a couple of instructions:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Hi-Folks/gh-actions-yaml-generator.git
cd gh-actions-yaml-generator
cp .env.example .env
composer install
php artisan key:generate
npm i
npm run production
```
Then create your database and update the .env file with the right values for DB_* .

Once your Database is configured you can execute the migrations:
```shell
php artisan migrate
```
Start development server
```shell
php artisan serve
```
Open the browser to the URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Usage
Follow these steps:
- access to the form (by default the URL is http://127.0.0.1:8000 if you run php artisan serve);
- fill the form;
- click on "Generate Yaml File" button.

Next, copy the content of your generated Yaml in a new file in your Laravel project _.github/workflows/laravel_workflow.yaml_ .

Commit and push the new file.

If you configured "On - Push" you will see the running Actions in your Actions section of your GitHub project.
