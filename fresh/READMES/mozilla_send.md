Mozilla discontinued the Firefox Send service in September 2021. For more information about this, please see the [Mozilla Blog](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/09/17/update-on-firefox-send-and-firefox-notes/).

You may fork and modify the source code for Firefox Send pursuant to the Mozilla Public License, but you may not create a version of the service that uses Mozilla trademarks or logos.

This repository is archived. In May 2021, Mozilla removed Mozilla trademarks from some of the files in this repository so that developers using this code are less likely to inadvertently infringe Mozilla's trademarks and confuse users.
