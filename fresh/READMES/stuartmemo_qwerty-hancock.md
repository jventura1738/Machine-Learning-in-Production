# Qwerty Hancock

Need an instant musical keyboard for your web audio project? Qwerty Hancock is just the thing.

Specify the number of octaves you want, give it a height and a width, then you're ready to use your mouse or keyboard to have the time of your life.

For a demo, and to see how else you can customise your keyboard, visit the [Qwerty Hancock homepage](http://stuartmemo.com/qwerty-hancock).

## Usage

Add the minified version of the code to your html by adding the following script tag.
```html
<script src="scripts/qwerty-hancock.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, if you're a bower fan: `bower install qwerty-hancock`

## Keyboard

Once you've included Qwerty Hancock on your page, visit the [Qwerty Hancock homepage](http://stuartmemo.com/qwerty-hancock) for information on how to initialise and customise the keyboard.
