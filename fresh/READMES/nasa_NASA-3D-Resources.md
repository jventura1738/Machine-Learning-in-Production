NASA-3D-Resources
=================

Welcome to the 3D Resources github site. Here you'll find a growing collection of 3D models, textures, and images from inside NASA. All of these resources are free to download and use. 

Please read the Usage Guidelines here:

Our team's goal is to provide a one-stop shop for 3D models, images, textures, and visualizations. We offer these assets for your use, free and without copyright. We recognize that the site is only as good as its contributors and thank them kindly.

We welcome feedback and comments. Tell us how you're using our models, and let us know what you think: arc-special-proj@lists.nasa.gov

We acknowledge and thank the many authors who have contributed to the 3D Resources collections.
