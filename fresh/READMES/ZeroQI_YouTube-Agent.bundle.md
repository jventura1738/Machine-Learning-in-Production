--restrict-filenames
Restrict filenames to only ASCII characters, and avoid "&" and spaces in filenames, makes the filenames slightly messy but no crash due to unsupported character

Requirements
- Do create your own YouTube API key and replace in ASS code and agent settings
- Please use the Absolute Series Scanner to scan your media and leave the YouTube id in the series/movie title
- leave the YouTube video ID on every file
- Playlist (preffered) id OR Channel id on series foldername (as Search() need to assign an id to the series)

Naming convention for Movie/Home Video library:
- filename without extension named exactly the same as the YouTube video
- filename with youtube video id '[xxxxxxxxxx]'or '[youtube-xxxxxxxxxx]'

Naming convention for TV Series library:
- movies have to be put in identically named folder named exactly the same as the YouTube video or have youtube video id
- series foldername with with youtube playlist id '[PLxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]' in title or inside a youtube.id file at its root
- series foldername with with youtube channel id '[UCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]' in title or inside a youtube.id file at its root

Note:
- The Absolute Series Scanner will support youtube.id file in series folder and pass it to the agent through the series title
- The agent will support the following formats in file or folder names [xxxxxxxx], [youtube-xxx], [YouTube-xxx], and [Youtube-xxx ]
- [!] register your own API key and also replace API_KEY='AIzaSyC2q8yjciNdlYRNdvwbb7NEcDxBkv1Cass' in ass code and the agent setting [Agent_youtube_api_key] OR you will deplete the quota of requests in MY account and metadata will stop for ALL users using default settings. 
- You can use grouping folders and a collection field will be created. If the logs complain about 'INFO (__init__:527) - Place correct Plex token in X-Plex-Token.id file in logs folder or in PLEX_LIBRARY_URL variable to have a log per library - https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/204059436-Finding-your-account-token-X-Plex-Token', then create a "Plex Media Server/X-Plex-Token.id" containing the Plex token id by logging on plex.tv/desktop, then https://plex.tv/devices.xml, it will be MediaContainer/Device ... token="xxxxxxxxxxxxxx".

Troubleshooting:
================
If you ask for something already answered in the readme, or post scanner issues on the agent page or vice-versa, please donate (will be refered to as the RTFM tax)

If files and series are showing in Plex GUI with the right season, the scanner did its job
If you miss metadata (serie title wrong, no posters, summary, wrong episode title or summaries, ep screenshot, etc...), that is the Agent doing.

To avoid already solved issues, and make sure you do include all relevant logs in one go, please do the following:
- Update to the latest Absolute Series Scanner, Youtube-Agent
- deleting all Plex logs leaving folders intact
- restart Plex
- Update the series Metadata
- including all the following logs: (location: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/200250417-Plex-Media-Server-Log-Files)
   - [...]/Plex Media Server/Logs/PMS Plugin Logs/com.plexapp.agents.Youtube-Agent.log (Agent logs)
   - [...]/Plex Media Server/Logs/PMS Plugin Logs/com.plexapp.system.log (show why the agent cannot launch)
   - Screen capture to illustrate if needed. Above logs are still mandatory

Support thread for agent:
- https://github.com/ZeroQI/YouTube-Agent.bundle/issues (proven or confident enough it's a bug. Include the symptoms, the logs mentionned above)
- https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/83106/rel-youtube-metadata-agent/p5 (not sure if bug, if bug will create a gihub issue ticket)
