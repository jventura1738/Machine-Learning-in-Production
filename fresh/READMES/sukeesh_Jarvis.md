A Personal Assistant for Linux, MacOS and Windows

![Jarvis](http://i.imgur.com/xZ8x9ES.jpg)

Jarvis is a simple personal assistant for Linux, MacOS and Windows which works on the command line. He can talk to you if you enable his voice. He can tell you the weather, he can find restaurants and other places near you. He can do some great stuff for you.

## Getting Started

In order to start Jarvis just clone [this repository](https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis.git) and run `python installer`.

Run **Jarvis** from anywhere by command `jarvis`

On Mac OS X run `source setup.sh`

On Windows run `setup.bat`

You can start by typing `help` within the Jarvis command line to check what Jarvis can do for you.

## Optional Dependencies

- Any pyttsx3 text-to-speech engine (``sapi5, nsss or espeak``) for Jarvis to talk out loud (e.g. Ubuntu do ``sudo apt install espeak``)
- Portaudio + python-devel packages for voice control
- ``notify-send`` on Linux if you want to receive *nice* and desktop-notification instead of *ugly* pop up windows (e.g. Ubuntu do ``sudo apt install libnotify-bin``)
- ``ffmpeg`` if you want ``music`` to download songs as .mp3 instead of .webm
