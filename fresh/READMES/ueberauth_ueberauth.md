> An Elixir Authentication System for Plug-based Web Applications

Ueberauth is two-phase authentication framework that provides a clear API -
allowing for many strategies to be created and shared within the community. It
is heavily inspired by [Omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth). You
could call it a port but it is significantly different in operation - but
almost the same concept. Huge hat tip to [Intridea](https://github.com/intridea).

Ueberauth provides only the initial authentication challenge, (initial OAuth
flow, collecting the information from a login form, etc). It does not
authenticate each request, that's up to your application. You could issue a
token or put the result into a session for your applications needs. Libraries
like [Guardian](https://github.com/hassox/guardian) can help you with that
aspect of authentication.

The two phases are `request` and `callback`. These phases are implemented by
Strategies.

## Strategies

Strategies are plugs that decorate or intercept requests (or both).

Strategies implement the two phases and then may allow the request to flow
through to your downstream plugs. Implementing the request and callback phases
is optional depending on the strategies requirements. If a strategy does not
redirect, the request will be decorated with Ueberauth information and
allowed to carry on through the pipeline.

See the full list of the strategies on the [Wiki](https://github.com/ueberauth/ueberauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies).

## Request Phase

The request phase is where you request information about the user. This could
be a redirect to an OAuth2 authorization url or a form for collecting username
and password. The request phase is concerned with only the collection of
information. When a request comes in on the request phase url the relevant
strategy will receive the `handle_request!` call.

In some cases (default) the application using Ueberauth is responsible for
implementing the request phase. That is, you should set up a route to receive
the request phase and provide a form etc. In some cases, like OAuth, the
request phase is used to redirect your user to a 3rd party site to fulfill
the request.

For example, an OAuth strategy for GitHub will receive the request phase url
and stop the request, redirecting you to GitHub’s OAuth challenge url with
some query parameters. Once you complete the GitHub OAuth flow, the user will
be redirected back to the host site to the callback URL.

Another example is simple email/password authentication. A request is made by
the client to the request phase path and the host application displays a form.
The strategy will likely not do anything with the incoming `handle_request!`
request and simply pass through to the application. Once the form is completed,
the POST should go to the callback url where it is handled (passwords checked,
users created / authenticated).

## Callback Phase

The callback phase is where the fun happens. Once a successful request phase has been completed, the request phase provider (OAuth provider or host site, etc)
should call the callback URL. The strategy will intercept the request via the `callback_phase!`. If successful, it should prepare the connection so the `Ueberauth.Auth` struct can be created, or set errors to indicate a failure.

See `Ueberauth.Strategy` for more information on constructing the Ueberauth.Auth struct.

## Setup

### Add the dependency

```elixir
# mix.exs

defp deps do
  # Add the dependency
  [{:ueberauth, "~> 0.6"}]
end
```

### Fetch the dependencies

```shell
mix deps.get
```

## Configuring providers

In your configuration file (`config/config.exs`) provide a list of the providers you intend to use. For example:

```elixir
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  providers: [
    facebook: { Ueberauth.Strategy.Facebook, [ opt1: "value", opts2: "value" ] },
    github: { Ueberauth.Strategy.Github, [ opt1: "value", opts2: "value" ] }
  ]
```

This will define two providers for you. The general structure of the providers value is:

```elixir
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  providers: [
    <provider name>: { <Strategy Module>, [ <strategy options> ] }
  ]
```

We use the configuration options for defining these to allow for dependency
injection in different environments. The provider name will be used to construct
request and response paths (by default) but will also be returned in the
`Ueberauth.Auth` struct as the `provider` field.

Once you've setup your providers, in your router you need to configure the plug
to run. The plug should run before your application routes.

In phoenix, plug this module in your controller:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.AuthController do
  use MyApp.Web, :controller
  plug Ueberauth
  ...
end
```

Its URL matching is done via pattern matching rather than explicit runtime
checks so your strategies will only fire for relevant requests.

Now that you have this, your strategies will intercept relevant requests for
each strategy for both request and callback phases. The default urls are (for
our Facebook & GitHub example)

```
# Request phase paths
/auth/facebook
/auth/github

# Callback phase paths
/auth/facebook/callback
/auth/github/callback
```

## Customizing Paths

These paths can be configured on a per strategy basis by setting options on
the provider.

Note: These paths are absolute

```elixir
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  base_path: "/login", # default is "/auth"
  providers: [
    identity: {Ueberauth.Strategies.Identity, [request_path: "/login/identity",
                                               callback_path: "/login/identity/callback"]}
  ]
```

## Customizing JSON Serializer

Your JSON serializer can be configured depending on what you have installed in your application.  Defaults to [Jason](https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason).

```elixir
config :ueberauth, Ueberauth,
  json_library: Poison # default is Jason
```

## HTTP Methods

By default, all callback URLs are only available via the `"GET"` method. You
can override this via options to your strategy.

```elixir
providers: [
  identity: {Ueberauth.Strategies.Identity, [callback_methods: ["POST"]]}
]
```

## Strategy Options

All options that are passed into your strategy are available at runtime to
modify the behaviour of the strategy.
