## Ballista is now part of Apache Arrow!

This repository is now archived and development is now happening in a new Apache Arrow repository:

- [https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion)

We will now use the official [ASF Slack](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust#arrow-rust-community) for 
informal discussions and coordination. This is a great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to 
contribute. Join us in the `#arrow-rust` channel.

Also, see [Arrow Rust Community](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust#arrow-rust-community) for more 
information on how to interact with the project.
