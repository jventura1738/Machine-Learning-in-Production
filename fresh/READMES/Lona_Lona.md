## Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/Lona.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/airbnb/Lona)

Lona is a collection of tools for building design systems and using them to generate cross-platform UI code, Sketch files, and other artifacts.

Lona consists primarily of 3 parts:

- [Lona Components](#lona-components) - A data format, `.component`, for cross-platform components
- [Lona Studio](#lona-studio) - A GUI tool for designing `.component` files
- [Lona Compiler](#lona-compiler) - A CLI tool & API for generating UI code from `.component` files

Why Lona? Read more about challenges with cross-platform design systems at scale, and how Lona solves them [here](./docs/overview/background.md).

### Lona Components

A design system is defined in JSON as a collection of:

- Components (can be nested)
- Colors, Text Styles, Gradients, and Shadows
- Data Types

The specification for these files can be found in the [docs](./docs/file-formats/README.md).

### Lona Studio

Lona Studio provides a graphical interface for working with `.component` files.

Lona Studio is primarily for building component systems, but can also be used for:

- Quickly mocking up new screens from existing components
- Viewing designs with real data from JSON files or APIs
- Experimenting with designs across multiple screen sizes
- Automating design tasks - e.g. localizing screenshots for different languages and exporting hundreds of images
- Working with animations (Lottie) and rendering videos from them
- and more!

If you have Xcode installed, you can try it out by following the [installation instructions](./studio/README.md).

> Wondering if this replaces Sketch? Why a native Mac App? I answer some common questions here in the [FAQ](./docs/overview/faq.md).

### Lona Compiler

The Lona Compiler converts .component files to UI code for various targets.

Currently, these targets are supported:

- iOS / macOS (Swift)
- React DOM / React Native / React Sketchapp (JavaScript)

Support is planned for:

- Android (Kotlin)

The target with the most features currently is Swift. However, it's still fairly rough. If you want to try it out, check out the [installation instructions](./compiler/core/README.md).

If you're looking for a sample of the generated code, check out [the test cases](./examples/generated/test)
