## My solutions to Leetcode

I will put my solutions to [Leetcode Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) in this repo. Every problem will be solved in C++; part of the problems will be solved in Java also. I will try my best to support more language in the future :)

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions with this repo:)

大家好，欢迎大家来到我的 **Leetcode 算法题解**代码仓。在这个代码仓中，近乎每一个问题都会使用多种方式进行解决，同时标注了简明的算法思想，时间复杂度和空间复杂度。所有问题都会使用C++进行解决，各别问题支持Java语言和Python语言。

由于 Leetcode 如今已经问题量巨大，所以很多同学可能会刷起来毫无头绪。推荐大家可以使用 Leetcode 在2017年底推出的 [**Leetcode Explore**](https://leetcode.com/explore/)，这个模块分门别类地整理了Leetcode上的问题，是一个很好的刷 Leetcode 的指引。Leetcode Explore模块上的题解，可以参考我的代码仓：[**Play Leetcode Explore**](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/Play-Leetcode-Explore)
