## Notice

We're actively working on a Haul successor, which would provide long awaited features like Hot Module Replacement + React Refresh and better feature-parity with Metro. The version `1.0.0` is already released!

If you're investigating using Haul, we highly recommend giving a [react-native-webpack-toolkit](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-webpack-toolkit) a go.

If you're already using Haul, we recommend migrating to [react-native-webpack-toolkit](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-webpack-toolkit) for better developer experience and feature set. The migration process is fairly straighforward, since you now have full access to `webpack.config.js`.

---

Haul is a drop-in replacement for `react-native` CLI built on open tools like Webpack. It can act as a development server or bundle your React Native app for production.

`@haul-bundler/cli` and other packages under `@haul-bundler` scope are a overhaul of `haul` package __and support only React Native 0.59.0 and above__. If you need to support older versions, please check [`legacy` branch](https://github.com/callstack/haul/tree/legacy).

`@haul-bundler/cli` and other packages __requires Node 10 to be installed__. If you're running older version, please upgrade to Node 10 LTS or newer.

## Features

- Replaces React Native packager to bundle your app
- Access to full webpack ecosystem, using additional loaders and plugins is simple
- Doesn't need watchman, symlinks work nicely
- Helpful and easy to understand error messages

## Getting started

Start by adding Haul as a dependency to your React Native project (use `react-native init MyProject` to create one if you don't have a project):

```bash
yarn add --dev @haul-bundler/cli

# Traditionalist? No problem:
npm install --save-dev @haul-bundler/cli
```

To configure your project to use haul, run the following:

```bash
yarn haul init
# npm >= 5.2.0 :
npx haul init
# npm < 5.2.0 :
npm install -g npx
npx haul init
```

This will automatically add the configuration needed to make Haul work with your app, e.g. add `haul.config.js` to your project, which you can customize to add more functionality.

Next, you're ready to start the development server:

```bash
yarn haul start
# Or:
npx haul start
```

Finally, reload your app to update the bundle or run your app just like you normally would:

```bash
react-native run-ios
```

## Documentation

Check out the docs to learn more about available commands and tips on customizing the webpack configuration.

1. [CLI Commands](docs/CLI%20Commands.md)
2. [Configuration](docs/Configuration.md)
3. [Recipes](docs/Recipes.md)
4. [Migration guide](docs/Migration.md)

<!-- ### Hot Module Replacement

__Hot Module Replacement is an experimental feature and it's disabled by default.__

Please refer to the [Setup guide](./docs/HMR_Setup.md). -->

## Limitations

Haul uses a completely different architecture from React Native packager, which means there are some things which don't work quite the same.

* Delta Bundles (RN 0.52+) have minimal support
* Existing `react-native` commands
* No support for Hot Module Replacement

The following features are **unlikely to be supported** in the future:

- Haste module system: use something like [babel-plugin-module-resolver](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver) instead
- Transpile files under `node_modules`: transpile your modules before publishing, or configure webpack not to ignore them
