# Virtualization-Documentation

Rendered documentation website [https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/).

Place to store our documentation, code samples, etc for public consumption and contributions.

## Contribute
To contribute, fork the project and submit a pull request!  Here's [our wishlist](./TODO.md).

If you want to submit prospective content but contributing to public documentation takes too much time/planning, submit your idea or draft to the [Prospective Docs](./prospective-docs) folder and we'll figure it out from there.

Digging into the repo structure a little:

### Virtualization -- Contribute docs here! -- 

This is a mirrored copy of the documentation available on the [virtualization documentation on docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/).

The folder structure matched the URL structure for the website.

**For example:**  Say you want to edit the user guide article for working with checkpoints.  
docs.microsoft.com location: [https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/checkpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/checkpoints)  
doc location:  
`virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/user_guide/checkpoints.md`
  
If you add a screen shot or picture, put it in the media folder closest to the article you're contributing to.  For the checkpoints userguide, that would be:  
`virtualization/hyperv_on_windows/user_guide/media`

### Demos
Demos of Hyper-V.  These are public scripts from various presentations and conferences.

Everything in here was made to present once.  There are many egregious hacks.  Don't use any of it in production.

### *-samples
Walkthroughs and samples.

### *-tools
Scripts to automate Hyper-V/Windows Container things.
