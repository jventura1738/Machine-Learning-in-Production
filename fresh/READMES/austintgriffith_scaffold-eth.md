# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

🎛 Any web3 dev environment is complex, that's why 🏗 Scaffold-ETH comes with everything you need, already working together:

- Hardhat for your local blockchain, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- React for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made components and hooks.
- Ant for your UI. (You can easily changed to another library you prefer)
- Surge / S3 / IPFS for publishing your app.
- Tenderly / The Graph / Etherscan / Infura / Blocknative for infrastructure.
- Support for L2 / Sidechains like Optimism and Arbitrum.
