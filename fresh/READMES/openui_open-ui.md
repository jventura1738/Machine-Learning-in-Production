# Open UI
> **Tip:** This repo is in development. Ideas and patterns you'll see here are in-progress. You are encouraged to join in and help shape the foundation of Open UI.

**:rocket: Mission:** Maintain an open standard for UI and promote its adherence and adoption.

**:busts_in_silhouette: Audience:** The broader UI community including designers, engineers, and managers.

## Why?

We identify these issues in the UI community:

- **Effort** - Engineers waste countless hours of human effort duplicating work that could be shared.
- **Support** - Accessible users are often left with subpar experiences, or are entirely unsupported.
- **Consistency** - User experience is often inconsistent and compromised between UIs due to isolated development practices.
- **Portability** - The lack of a shared language for UI limits our ability as a community to communicate, collaborate, and share.
- **Timing** - UI's have existed long enough to observe and codify a shared standard; the time is right.

Open UI is a open source collective effort to standardize names and anatomies for common UI patterns.

## How?

There are two pillars of focus here:
  - `/research` documenting UI as it has naturally emerged
  - `/platform` representing browser testing for component support against common use cases using standards based approaches

These two will iterate in a cyclic collaboration to define and develop standardized UI.
Refer to the resources in each effort for more information.
