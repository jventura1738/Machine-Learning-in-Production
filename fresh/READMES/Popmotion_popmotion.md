Popmotion is:
- **Powerful**: It supports keyframe and spring animations for numbers, colors and complex strings.
- **Low level**: It's designed to be composable and portable into any JavaScript environment, with an eye on worklets in the future.
- **Stable**: It's written in TypeScript and enjoys over 95% test coverage.
- **Tiny**: `animate` is just ~4.5kb, and every function is individually importable.

<!-- Documentation -->

## Quick start

```bash
npm install popmotion
```

```javascript
import { animate } from "popmotion"

animate({
  from: 0,
  to: 100,
  onUpdate: latest => console.log(latest)
})
```

## Animation

### animate

`animate` performs a keyframes or spring animation.

```javascript
import { animate } from "popmotion"

animate({
  from: 0, 
  to: 100,
  onUpdate: latest => console.log(latest)
})
```

It can animate numbers:

```javascript
animate({ from: 0, to: 100 })
```

Or strings of the same type:

```javascript
animate({ from: "0px", to: "100px" })
animate({ from: "#fff", to: "#000" })
```

The strings can be pretty complex, for instance box shadows or SVG path definitions. The only limitation is that the numbers and colors contained within must be in the same order:

```javascript
animate({
  from: "0px 0px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)",
  to: "10px 10px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)"
})
```

<!--
Arrays of the above:

```javascript
animate({
  from: [0, "#fff"],
  to: [100, "#000"]
})
```

And objects of the above:

```javascript
animate({
  from: { x: 0, backgroundColor: "#fff" },
  to: { x: 100, backgroundColor: "#000" }
})
```
-->

The type of animation performed will be automatically detected from the provided options, or can be chosen manually by defining `type` as `"keyframes"`, `"spring"` or `"decay"`.

#### Options

These options can be set for **all animations**:

##### from

An initial value to start the animation from.

Defaults to `0`

```javascript
animate({
  from: "linear-gradient(#e66465, #9198e5)",
  to: "linear-gradient(#9198e5, #e66465)"
})
```

##### elapsed

Sets an initial elapsed time, in milliseconds. Set to a negative value for a delay.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  elapsed: -300
})
```

##### repeat

The number of times to repeat the animation. Set to `Infinity` to repeat forever.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  repeat: 2
})
```

##### repeatDelay

The duration, in milliseconds, to wait before repeating the animation.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  repeat: 2,
  repeatDelay: 200
})
```

##### repeatType

Either `"loop"`, `"mirror"` or `"reverse"`. Defaults to `"loop"`.

- `"loop"`: Repeats the animation from `0`.
- `"mirror":` Swaps the `from`/`to` values alternately.
- `"reverse":` Reverses the animation alternately.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  repeat: 2,
  repeatType: "reverse"
})
```

##### driver

By default, the animation will be driven by a `requestAnimationFrame` loop. `driver` can specify a different source.

A `Driver` is a function that accepts the animations `update` function. This is a function that can be called with a time delta from the previous frame. The `Driver` must return a function that will be called when the animation is stopped.

```javascript
const xrDriver = session => update => {
  let latestRequestId = 0
  let prevTimestamp = performance.now()
  
  const step = timestamp => {
    const delta = timestamp - prevTimestamp
    prevTimestamp = timestamp

    update(delta)

    latestRequestId = session.requestAnimationFrame(step)
  }

  let latestRequestId = session.requestAnimationFrame(step)

  return () => session.cancelRequestAnimationFrame(latestRequestId)
}

animate({
  to: 100,
  driver: xrDriver(xrSession)
})
```

##### type

`animate` will automatically detect the type of animation to use based on the options provided. But a specific type can be chosen manually by defining `type` as `"keyframes"`, `"spring"` or `"decay"`.

```jsx
animate({
  to: 100,
  type: "spring"
})
```

#### Lifecycle events

The following lifecycle events are available for **all animations**:

##### onUpdate

This is called every frame the animation fires with the latest computed value.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  onUpdate: latest => console.log(latest)
})
```

##### onPlay

This is called when the animation starts. Currently this automatically when `animate` is called.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  onPlay: () => {}
})
```

##### onComplete

This is called when the animation successfully completes.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  onComplete:() => {}
})
```

##### onRepeat

This is called when an animation repeats.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  repeat: 2,
  onRepeat: () => {}
})
```

##### onStop

This is called when the animation is stopped by the `stop` control.

```javascript
const animation = animate({
  to: 100,
  onStop: () => {}
})

animation.stop()
```

#### Keyframes options

A keyframes animation is the default animation type and it can be defined either with a `from` and `to` option:

```javascript
animate({ from: 0, to: 100 })
```

Or as a series of keyframes provided to the `to` option:

```javascript
animate({ to: [0, 100, 200] })
```

##### to

A single value to animate to, or an array of values to animate through.

```javascript
animate({
  to: ["#0ff", "#f00", "#0f0"]
})
```

If `to` is an array, any defined `from` will be ignored.

##### duration

This defines the duration of the animation, in milliseconds.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  duration: 300
})
```

##### ease

This is an easing function, or array of functions, to use when easing between each keyframe.

```javascript
import { animate, linear, easeInOut } from "popmotion"

animate({
  to: 100,
  ease: linear
})

animate({
  to: ["#fff", "#000", "#f00"],
  ease: [linear, easeInOut]
})
```

If set as any array, the length of this array must be one shorter than the number of values being animated between.

##### offset

This is an array of values between `0` and `1` that defines at which point throughout the animation each keyframe should be reached.

This array should be the same length as the number of defined keyframes.

```javascript
animate({
  to: ["#fff", "#000", "#f00"],
  offset: [0, 0.2, 1]
})
```

#### Spring options

Springs are great for creating natural-feeling interfaces and dynamic interruptable animations.

A spring animation will be used if any of the `stiffness`, `damping` or `mass` options are detected.

**Note:** A spring simulation is inherently numerical so if it's given a color, array or object, it runs the animation from `0` to `100` and interpolates that to the given values. This strategy is likely to be tweaked before the official release so animations made this way may change in feel.

##### to

A single value to animate to.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  type: "spring"
})
```

If `to` is an array, any defined `from` will be ignored.

##### stiffness

This defines the stiffness of the spring. A higher stiffness will result in a snappier animation.

Defaults to `100`

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  stiffness: 1000
})
```

##### damping

This is the opposing force to `stiffness`. As you reduce this value, relative to `stiffness`, the spring will become bouncier and the animation will last longer. Likewise, higher relative values will have less bounciness and result in shorter animations.

Defaults to `10`

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  damping: 50
})
```

##### mass

This is the mass of the animating object. Heavier objects will take longer to speed up and slow down.

Defaults to `1`.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  mass: 2
})
```

##### velocity

The initial velocity, in units per second, of the animation.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  velocity: 1000
})
```

##### duration

The duration of the spring, in milliseconds.

Will be overridden by `stiffness`, `mass` or `damping`.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  duration: 1000
})
```

##### bounce

The bounciness of the spring, as a value between `0` and `1`, where `0` is no bounce.

Will be overridden by `stiffness`, `mass` or `damping`.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  bounce: 0.2
})
```

##### restDelta

The distance from the animation target at which the animation can be considered complete. When both `restDelta` and `restSpeed` are met, the animation completes.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  restDelta: 0.5
})
```

##### restSpeed

The absolute velocity, in units per second, below which the animation can be considered complete. When both `restDelta` and `restSpeed` are met, the animation completes. Defaults to `10`.

```javascript
animate({
  to: 100,
  restSpeed: 5
})
```

#### Playback controls

`animate` returns `PlaybackControls`, which can be used to control the playback of the animation.

Currently this only includes a `stop` method, but may expand with more.

##### stop

Stops the animation.

```javascript
const playback = animate({ from: 0, to: 100 })
playback.stop()
```

### inertia

The `inertia` animation is used to gradually decelerate a number. Think smartphone scroll momentum.

#### Options

In addition to `animate`'s `from`, `onUpdate` and `onComplete` options, `inertia` also supports the following:

##### velocity

The initial velocity, in units per second, of the animation.

```javascript
inertia({
  from: 0,
  velocity: 100
})
```

##### power

A constant with which to calculate a target value. Higher power = further target.

Defaults to `0.8`.

```javascript
inertia({
  from: 0,
  power: 0.3
})
```

##### timeConstant

Adjusting the time constant will change the duration of the deceleration, thereby affecting its feel.

Defaults to `350`.

```javascript
inertia({
  from: 0,
  velocity: 100,
  timeConstant: 400
})
```

##### modifyTarget

A function that receives the calculated target and returns a new one. Useful for snapping the target to a grid.

```javascript
const roundToNearest = target => v => Math.ceil(v / target) * target

inertia({
  from: 0,
  velocity: 100,
  modifyTarget: roundToNearest(100)
})
```

##### min

The minimum value at which the animation will switch from gradual deceleration and use a spring animation to snap to this point.

```javascript
inertia({
  from: 50,
  velocity: -100,
  min: 0
})
```

##### max

The maximum value at which the animation will switch from gradual deceleration and use a spring animation to snap to this point.

```javascript
inertia({
  from: 50,
  velocity: 100,
  max: 100
})
```

##### bounceStiffness

This defines the stiffness of the spring when the animation hits either `min` or `max`. A higher stiffness will result in a snappier animation.

Defaults to `500`

```javascript
inertia({
  from: 0,
  velocity: 100,
  max: 50,
  bounceStiffness: 1000
})
```

##### bounceDamping

This is the opposing force to `bounceStiffness`. As you reduce this value, relative to `bounceStiffness`, the spring will become bouncier and the animation will last longer. Likewise, higher relative values will have less bounciness and result in shorter animations.

Defaults to `10`

```javascript
inertia({
  from: 0,
  velocity: 100,
  max: 50,
  bounceDamping: 300
})
```

##### restDelta

The distance from the animation target at which the animation can be considered complete.

```javascript
inertia({
  from: 0,
  velocity: 100,
  restDelta: 0.5
})
```

### Iterators

Powering `animate` and `inertia` are the `keyframes`, `spring`, and `decay` [iterators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol).

```javascript
import { keyframes, spring, decay } from "popmotion";
```

Iterators give you the ability to run an animation with a high degree of control. For example, [Framer](https://framer.com) uses the `spring` iterator to draw its animation editor visualiser by running it synchronously.

Each can be initialised with the matching options above (`decay` with a subset of `inertia`'s options, excluding the `bounce-` options):

```javascript
const animation = spring({
  from: 0,
  to: 100,
  stiffness: 200
})
```

With the returned iterator, you can resolve the animation at a specific timestamp with its `next` method.

```javascript
// Resolve the animation at 200ms
const { value, done } = animation.next(200)
```

## Easing

Popmotion includes a number of in-built easing functions, as well as factory functions to make entirely new ones.

### Functions

Each easing function can be imported like so:

```javascript
import { linear } from "popmotion"
```

Each function accepts a progress value between `0` and `1`, and returns a new one:

```javascript
const progress = 0.5
const easedProgress = easeInOut(progress)
```

 - `linear`
 - `easeIn`
 - `easeInOut`
 - `easeOut`
 - `circIn`
 - `circInOut`
 - `circOut`
 - `backIn`
 - `backInOut`
 - `backOut`
 - `anticipate`
 - `bounceIn`
 - `bounceInOut`
 - `bounceOut`

### Factories

#### cubicBezier

```javascript
import { cubicBezier } from "popmotion"

const easing = cubicBezier(0, .42, 0, 1)
```

New cubic bezier definitions can be created in the [Framer](https://framer.com) animation editor and copy/pasted directly into this function.

#### steps

`steps` returns an easing function that will convert the animation into a discrete series of steps.

```javascript
import { steps } from "popmotion"

const easing = steps(5)
```

It optionally accepts a second parameter, either `"start"` or `"end"` (default)that decides whether the steps are aligned with the start or end of the animation.

```javascript
steps(5, "start")
```

#### mirrorEasing

Mirrors an existing easing function. 

#### reverseEasing

Reverses an existing easing function. For instance, providing it `easeIn` would return an `easeOut`.

```javascript
import { reverseEasing, linear } from "popmotion"

const reversed = reverseEasing(linear)
reversed(1) // 0
reversed(0.5) // 0.5
reversed(0) // 1
```

#### createExpoIn

Creates an easing function based on the exponent of the provided `power`. The higher the `power`, the stronger the easing.

```javascript
import { createExpoIn } from "popmotion"

const expoIn = createExpoIn(4)
```

The returned easing function is an ease in, which means it starts slow and finished fast. `mirrorEasing` and `reverseEasing` can be used to create ease in out, and ease out variations:

```javascript
const expoIn = createExpoIn(4)
const expoOut = mirrorEasing(easeIn)
const expoInOut = reverseEasing(easeIn)
```

#### createBackIn

Creates an easing function with an overshoot. It accepts a `power` value, the higher the `power` the stronger the overshoot.

```javascript
import { createBackIn } from "popmotion"

const backIn = createBackIn(4)
```

The returned easing function is an ease in, which means the overshoot happens at the start of the animation. `mirrorEasing` and `reverseEasing` can be used to create ease in out, and ease out variations:

```javascript
const backIn = createBackIn(4)
const backOut = mirrorEasing(easeIn)
const backInOut = reverseEasing(easeIn)
```

#### createAnticipate

Creates an easing that pulls back a little before animating out with an overshoot. The stronger the `power` the bigger the overshoot.

```javascript
import { createAnticipate } from "popmotion"

const anticipate = createAnticipate(4)
```

## Utils

#### angle

Returns an angle between two points, in degrees.

```javascript
import { angle } from "popmotion"

angle(
  { x: 0, y: 0 },
  { x: 45, y: 100 }
)
```

#### attract


```javascript
import { attract } from "popmotion"

attract(5, 10, 12)
```

#### attractExpo

```javascript
import { attractExpo } from "popmotion"

attractExpo(5, 10, 12)
```

#### clamp

Clamp a value to within the given range.

```javascript
import { clamp } from "popmotion"

const min = 50
const max = 100
clamp(min, max, 150) // 100
```

#### degreesToRadians

Converts degrees to radians.

```javascript
import { degreesToRadians } from "popmotion"

degreesToRadians(45) // 0.785...
```

#### distance

Returns the distance between two numbers, two 2D points, or two 3D points.

```javascript
import { distance } from "popmotion"

distance(10, 50)
distance({ x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 45, y: 100 })
distance({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 100 }, { x: 45, y: 100, z: 0 })
```

#### interpolate

Creates a function that will interpolate from an linear series of numbers, to a non-linear series of numbers, strings of the same numerical format, colours, or arrays/objects of those.

```javascript
import { interpolate } from "popmotion"

const mapXToOpacity = interpolate(
  [-100, 0, 100],
  [0, 1, 0]
)
mapXToOpacity(-50) // 0.5

const mapProgressToValues = interpolate(
  [0, 1],
  [
    { x: 0, color: "#fff" },
    { x: 100, color: "#000" }
  ]
)
mapProgressToValues(0.5) // { x: 50, color: "#888" }

const rescale = interpolate(
  [0, 1],
  [100, 200],
  { clamp: false }
)
rescale(2) // 300
```

#### Options

`interpolate` accepts an optional third argument, an object of options.

- `clamp`: Clamps values to within given range. Defaults to `true`.
- `ease`: An `Easing` function, or array of easing functions, to ease the interpolation of each segment.
- `mixer`: A function that, when provided a `from` and `to` value, will return a new function that accepts a progress value between `0` and `1` to mix between those two values. For integration with libraries like Flubber.

#### isPoint

Returns `true` if the provided argument is a 2D point.

```javascript
import { isPoint } from "popmotion"

isPoint({ x: 0 }) // false
isPoint({ x: 0, y: 0 }) // true
```

#### isPoint3D

Returns `true` if the provided argument is a 3D point.

```javascript
import { isPoint3D } from "popmotion"

isPoint3D({ x: 0 }) // false
isPoint3D({ x: 0, y: 0 }) // false
isPoint3D({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }) // true
```

#### mix

Will mix between two values, given `progress` as a third argument.

```javascript
import { mix } from "popmotion"

mix(0, 100, 0.5) // 50
mix(0, 100, 2) // 200
```

#### mixColor

Returns a function that, when provided a `progress` value, will mix between two colors. Accepts hex, rgba and hsla colors.

```javascript
import { mixColor } from "popmotion"

mixColor("#000", "#fff")(0.5) // "rgba(125, 125, 125, 1)"
```

#### mixComplex

Returns a function that, when provided a `progress` value, will mix between two strings with the same order of numbers and colors.

```javascript
import { mixComplex } from "popmotion"

mixComplex("100px #fff", "0px #000")(0.5) // "50px rgba(125, 125, 125, 1)"
```

#### pointFromVector

Given a point, angle in degrees, and distance, will return a new point.

```javascript
import { pointFromVector } from "popmotion"

const point = { x: 0, y: 0 }
const angle = 45
const distance = 100

pointFromVector(point, angle, distance)
```

#### progress

Given a min and a max range, and a value, will return the `progress` of the value within the range as normalised to a `0`-`1` range.

```javascript
import { progress } from "popmotion"

const min = 100
const max = 200
progress(min, max, 150) // 0.5
```

#### radiansToDegrees

Converts radians to degrees.

```javascript
import { radiansToDegrees } from "popmotion"

radiansToDegrees(0.785) // 45
```

#### snap

Creates a function that will snap numbers to the nearest in a provided array or to a regular interval.
