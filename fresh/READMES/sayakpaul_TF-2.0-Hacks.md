This respository contains my exploration of the newly released [TensorFlow 2.0](http://tensflow.org/). TensorFlow team introduced a lot of new and useful changes in this release; automatic mixed precision training, flexible custom  training, distributed GPU training, enhanced ops for the high-level Keras API are some of my personal favorites. 
You can see all of the new changes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPweUtct2yY). 

Apart from the official TensorFlow 2.0 [guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide) and the [tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials), I highly recommend the following resources if you want to learn more about TensorFlow 2.0 (updated on an ad-hoc basis):
