# Emacs Mac Port

## What is this? ##

Official repository: https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/overview

This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 27.  This provides a native
GUI support for Mac OS X 10.6 - macOS 11.  Note that Emacs 23 and
later already contain the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa)
port. So if it is good enough for you, then you don't need to try
this.

#### IMPORTANT NOTE ####

If you find a bug, then please try to reproduce it with some
official builds such as X11 or NS (Cocoa).  If it turns out to be
specific to the Mac port, then please report it to
<a href="mailto:mituharu+bug-gnu-emacs-mac@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp">mituharu+bug-gnu-emacs-mac@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp</a>.  Otherwise (i.e.,
it is also reproducible with official ones), report it using <kbd>M-x</kbd>
report-emacs-bug **USING THE OFFICIAL BUILD** as such.
