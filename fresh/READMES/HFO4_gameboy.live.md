# Gameboy.Live
üïπÔ∏è `Gameboy.Live` is a Gameboy emulator written in go for learning purposes. You can simply play Gameboy games on your desktop:

![https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/raw/master/doc/screenshot.png](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/raw/master/doc/screenshot.png)

Or, "Cloud Game" in your terminal with a single command (The demo server is down now, you have to deploy on you own server):

```
telnet gameboy.live 1989
```

## Installation

You can directly download the executable file from the [Release](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live/releases) page, or build it from the source. Go Version 1.11 or higher is required. Run `go version` to check what the version currently installed is. On Debian based systems, the packages `libasound2-dev` and `libgl1-mesa-dev` must be installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live.git
cd gameboy.live
go build -o gbdotlive main.go
```

## Usage

```
Usage of gbdotlive:
  -G    Play specific game in Fyne GUI mode
  -S    Start a static image cloud-gaming server
  -c config
        Set the game option list config file path
  -d    Use Debugger in GUI mode
  -f FPS
        Set the FPS in GUI mode (default 60)
  -g    Play specific game in GUI mode (default true)
  -h    This help
  -m    Turn on sound in GUI mode (default true)
  -p port
        Set the port for the cloud-gaming server (default 1989)
  -r ROM
        Set ROM file path to be played in GUI mode
  -s    Start a cloud-gaming server

```

### GUI mode

Play a specified ROM file in GUI mode:

```
gbdotlive -G -r "Tetris.gb" 
```

### Set up a telnet Cloud Gaming server

You can use `Gameboy.Live` as a "Cloud Gaming" server, where players use telnet to play Gameboy games in terminal without additional software installation required. (Except telnet itself xD)

A `gamelist.json` config file is required to specify game options. This is a typical example:

```json
[{
	"Title": "Tetris",
	"Path": "test.gb"
}, {
	"Title": "Dr. Mario",
	"Path": "Dr. Mario (JU) (V1.1).gb"
}, {
	"Title": "Legend of Zelda - Link's Awakening",
	"Path": "Legend of Zelda, The - Link's Awakening (U) (V1.2) [!].gb"
}]

```

It is recommended to test every ROM before putting them in the config file.

Next, start a `Gameboy.Live` server with the config file from the previous step:

```
gbdotlive -s -c "gamelist.json"
```

You will see an output like this, which means your server has started successfully:

```
2019/04/30 21:27:56 Listen port: 1989 
```

Now, you can play games anywhere you want! The simulation and rendering process is done entirely on the server.

```
telnet <ip of your server>:<port>
```

"Cloud Gaming" is only supported in terminals which support standard [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) and the UTF-8 charset. You can use `WSL` instead of `CMD` on Windows.

### Set up a static Cloud Gaming server

You can also set up a static cloud gaming server, where one specific game is emulated, everone can play it cooperatively by clicking hyperlinks. Start such a server with folowing command:

```
gbdotlive -S -r "Pokemon - Red Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced).gb" 
```

A HTTP server will start up on default port `1989`, these HTTP routes is avaliable to use:

| Routes                                                | Method | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/image`                                              | GET    | Show the latest game screenshot.                             |
| `/svg?callback=[Redirect URL]`                        | GET    | Show the latest game screenshot with Gameboy style border and clickable gamepad. An SVG template `gb.svg` is required. |
| `/control?button=[Button ID]&callback=[Redirect URL]` | GET    | Send new gamepad input.                                      |

#### WebSockets streaming

Thanks to [szymonWojdat](https://github.com/szymonWojdat), you can use websockets interface for sending static images so that you don't need to reload the website after each button press.

Make sure the static server above is already started up on default port `1989`.

- Use `ws://localhost:1989/stream` route in order to start a websocket communication channel.
- Images will be streamed to the client in PNG encoding.
- The client can send their input commands in text format using one of these codes:
    - Right Arrow: `0` 
    - Left Arrow: `1`
    - Up Arrow: `2`
    - Down Arrow: `3`
    - A: `4`
    - B: `5`
    - Select: `6`
    - Start: `7`
- check out `client_demo.html` for a simple demo and don't forget to run the server before by using the command above &#x1F31D;

### Debug

`Gameboy.Live` has a simple built-in debugger. To turn on debug mode, set the `d` flag to `true`:

```
gbdotlive -r "test.gb" -d=true
```

The emulator will firstly break at the ROM entry point `0x0100` in debug mode, which is the entry point of the game program. You can type the address of next breakpoint. The emulator will continue to run until the next breakpoint is reached. At each breakpoint, the emulator will print the register's contents like above and dump the main memory into `memory.dump` (ROM and RAM bank not included)

```
[OP:NOP]
AF:01B0  BC:0013  DE:00D8  HL:014D  SP:FFFE   
PC:0100  LCDC:91  IF:E1    IE:00    IME:false 
LCD:100 
```
