# Object Explorer

When I was first learning object methods, I spent a lot of time digging through the docs to find the appropriate one, and I had to search one by one. I made this resource to help people find the correct object method a bit more naturally. You can narrow down what you want to do and explore until you find what's most useful to you.

Or if you prefer codepen: [https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/rpwjzw/](https://codepen.io/sdras/pen/rpwjzw/)

I realize that there are about a million ways that this resource can be set up, and some of the taxonomy is necessarily opinionated. I tried to focus on what I thought would have helped me learn the best, rather than industry standard delineations. If that style of learning suits you better, that's great! This resource is not set up that way. Please keep in mind that this is not meant to be as comprehensive or a replacement for full documentation, which is why the MDN docs are linked to in each method.

I based most of the longer descriptions off of the MDN documentation, altering it slightly where I felt the description was not as beginner-friendly as it could be. The examples were kept as simple as humanly possible for the purpose of scanning with the least cognitive load, you may need extra details provided in the MDN documentation for every possible usage.

**Enjoy!**
