## Dependencies

The following are the dependencies that WoeUSB requires, in one way or another.  Refer [the wiki](https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB/wiki/Dependencies) for distro-specific information.

### Required

WoeUSB will not be able to function without these software installed in their proper locations:

* [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)  
  For interpreting and executing the program logic  
  _Requires >= 4.3_
* [The GNU Core Utilities(Coreutils)](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)  
  For common Unix utilities necessary for basic operations
* [util-linux](https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux)  
  For low-level utilities interacting with storage devices, etc
* [GNU Grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) and [Gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/)  
  For parsing necessary information out from a command output
* [The GNU Find Utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/)  
  For enumerating files required for operation
* [GNU GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)  
  For installing the bootstrap code used in a Legacy PC boot  
  We specifically requires modules of the i386-pc architecture, for Debian-based distributions these are provided via the grub-pc-bin package
* [GNU Parted](https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/)  
  For manipulating disk partition table and partitions
* [GNU Wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)  
  For acquiring [Pete Batard](https://pete.akeo.ie/)'s [UEFI:NTFS](https://github.com/pbatard/uefi-ntfs) UEFI bootloader
* [dosfstools](https://github.com/dosfstools/dosfstools)  
  For creating FAT filesystem in `--device` creation method
* [NTFS-3G](https://www.tuxera.com/community/open-source-ntfs-3g/)  
  For creating NTFS filesystem in `--device` creation method
* [wimlib](https://wimlib.net/)  
  For splitting install.wim Windows Imaging (WIM) archive so that archives over 4GiB can be fit in an FAT32 filesystem

### Optional

Without the following dependencies WoeUSB will still able to run, but some functionalities will be unavailable:

* [p7zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/)  
  For workaround the problem where the Windows 7 installation media doesn't ship their UEFI bootloader in the proper location
* [Pete Batard](https://pete.akeo.ie/)'s [UEFI:NTFS](https://github.com/pbatard/uefi-ntfs) UEFI bootloader  
  For supporting NTFS filesystems in the target USB key

## Installation

To be addressed.  For now refer [Run from source](#run-from-source).
