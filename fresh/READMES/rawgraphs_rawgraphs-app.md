## About

**RAWGraphs** is an open web tool to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) library.
It has been developed by [DensityDesign Research Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org/) ([Politecnico di Milano](http://www.polimi.it/)), [Calibro](http://calib.ro/) and [INMAGIK](https://inmagik.com/).

Primarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, RAWGraphs aims at providing a missing link between spreadsheet applications (e.g. LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Docs, …) and vector graphics editors (e.g. Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, …).

RAWGraphs works with [tabular data](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)>) (e.g. spreadhseets and comma-separated values) as well as with copied-and-pasted texts from other applications. Based on the [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg) format, visualizations can be easily edited with vector graphics applications for further refinements, or directly embedded into web pages.

Knowing the need of working with sensitive information, the data injected into RAWGraphs is processed only by the web browser: **no server-side operations or storages are performed** and no one will see, touch or copy your data!

RAWGraphs is also highly customizable and extensible, accepting new custom layouts defined by users. For more information about how to add or edit layouts, see the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/rawgraphs/raw/wiki/Developer-Guide).

## Usage

The easiest way to use RAWGraphs is by accessing the most updated version on the **[official app page](http://app.rawgraphs.io)**. However, RAWGraphs can also run locally on your machine: see the installation instructions below to know how.

## Installation

If you want to run your instance of RAWGraphs locally on your machine, be sure you have the following requirements installed. the following guide is meant for intermediate users (you will have to open your console and type some commands, it's better it you know what you are doing).

### Requirements

If you want to run your instance of RAWGraphs locally on your machine, be sure you have the following requirements installed.

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (it could be used through the interface of [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Instructions (Mac OS)

In terminal, browse the folder where you want to install the app, and clone `RAWGraphs-app` from the command line:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app.git
```

Browse the folder containing the repository:

```shell
cd rawgraphs-app
```

Install the needed dependencies through Yarn:

```shell
yarn install
```

Now you can run the project locally in development mode with the command:

```shell
yarn start
```

You can also build your own version and upload on your server by running the command:

```shell
yarn build
```
