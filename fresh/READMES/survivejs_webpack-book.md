# SurviveJS - Webpack 5

<img align="right" width="255" height="330" src="manuscript/images/title_page_small.png" />

> **IMPORTANT!** If you want to support the development of this book, you can [purchase a copy at Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/survivejs-webpack). A part (~30%) of the proceedings will go directly to the author of webpack to support its development.

Webpack, a module bundler, solves a significant problem for web developers. It can be daunting to learn but once you grok it, life gets easier. The purpose of this book is to make it easier to pick up the tool while learning more advanced techniques as well. You can [read the book online](http://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/).

## How to Use This Repository?

You can read the content easily through [the book site](https://survivejs.com/webpack/introduction/). It is also available within the `manuscript` directory of the repository.

Please note that the repository defaults to the `dev` branch of the book. `master` contains the source of the most recent version. Each version has been tagged so that it's easy for you to find the source matching to the version of the book you are reading.
