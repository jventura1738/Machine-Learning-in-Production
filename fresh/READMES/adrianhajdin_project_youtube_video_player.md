# Introduction
In this tutorial we are going to build a YouTube Clone Application from Scratch using React. This project is great for learning React because is covers a lot of concepts that appear often in ReactJS workflow. 

Setup:
- move a copy of .env.sample to .env and paste your API-key
- run ```npm i && npm start``` to start the development server

Covered topics:
- project structure
- destructuring
- state management (with hooks)
- passing props
- API calls

Suggested improvements:
- you should use Material-UIs makeStyles() hook instead of styles-prop to style your components
- implement mobile friendly UI
