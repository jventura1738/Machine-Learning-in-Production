- Elasticsearch 5.0.1
- Ruby 3.0.0

#### Installations
Gems:
```
bundle install
```

Elasticsearch:
See config/elasticsearch/README.md

Postgresql:

This is the best way if you're on mac: http://postgresapp.com/
But to install the pg gem, you will have to do:
```
gem install pg -- --with-pg-config=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin/pg_config
```

If you decide to install postgres with homebrew (`brew install postgresql`) you should not have this problem.

Why should you use the app? You have quick commandline tools such as:
The following tools come with Postgres.app:

Tests
-------------
We have put some time to test the api and the search. You may need to have elasticsearch running in order for the tests to go through search although we should be looking for an elasticsearch mock.

Simply run:
```
rspec
```
